== Git Protocol ==

Please see the discussion at {{talkq|Q186055|Git_Protocol}} and [[User talk:Konstin#Git Wire Protocol]], which depend on our understanding of the meaning of this property.

== Use for application items? ==

Examples:
* {{Statement|Q68453830|P2700|Q8777}}
* {{Statement|Q300662|P2700|Q42283}}
* {{Statement|Q61754440|P2700|Q22906785}}
To state a application can "speak" this protocol.
Currently {{P|P4428}} is sometimes used for this purpose, but it does not feel quite right.

* {{s}} Much better than {{Statement|Q17122691|2283|188951}} and {{statement|Q19718090|527|Q27031176}}. There is nothing wrong with {{P|P4428}} but {{P|2700}} is more specific and natural. â€”[[User:Dexxor|Dexxor]] ([[User talk:Dexxor|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:08, 31 July 2020 (UTC)
