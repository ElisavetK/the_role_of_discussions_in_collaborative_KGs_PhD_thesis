== Name ==

This is a really nice idea! Looking forward to seeing these start appearing on articles.

However, I think the name could be a little confusing in English - there "ex libris" is usually used to describe the book itself, so a book is "''ex libris'' Joe Smith's collection", and this is used regardless of whether it has a bookplate, or an inscription, or a stamp (or even no markings at all). It seems English is unusual here as most languages use some variant of "ex libris". I'd suggest switching the en label to something like "bookplate image". Thoughts?

*It's somewhat hard to input anything but an image? Commons uses "ex libris" without the "-". --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 23:44, 5 May 2020 (UTC)

::Oh, agreed that it has to be an image, so it's not that people will try and use it for recording provenance - it's just a bit confusingly labelled! It seems English is the outlier here which is probably why Commons prefers "ex libris" to "bookplate".

== Use of qualifier {{P|805}} ==
We seem to a have a couple of items for those of {{Q|Q93394292}}. I linked them with the above qualifier (images are missing AFAIK). --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 23:44, 5 May 2020 (UTC)
