{{Ping|Máté}}, do you know why they rated so few games before they stopped doing it? --[[User:Trade|Trade]] ([[User talk:Trade|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:26, 13 November 2020 (UTC)
:{{ping|Trade}} I am not sure how many games were released in Ireland over those roughly twp years they rated games. It might not be such a bad rate. [[User:Máté|Máté]] ([[User talk:Máté|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:30, 13 November 2020 (UTC)
::That depends whether or not we count 'interactive DVD games' as film or video games. I don't think there's a consensus on that. {{Ping|Máté}}--[[User:Trade|Trade]] ([[User talk:Trade|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:19, 13 November 2020 (UTC)
