== Mapping to RO ==

I believe the intent is that this intended to be used where the GO Consortium would use [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002331 involved in]. Note that the GOC is refining the set of relationships that can connect a gene product to a term (to track, follow this: https://github.com/orgs/geneontology/projects/13). Crucially, it will distinguish when a gene product is truly [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Involved_in involved in] a process such as apoptosis vs when it is [http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Acts_upstream_of acting upstream of it]. This will allow extraction of more precise gene sets. I can act as coordinator for Wikidata here. I suggest WD adopts the distinction too. I'm not sure whether this property should be mapped to the super-property or the more precise and useful involved-in. As an aside, I find the use of a noun phrase "biological process" for a property a bit odd.
 
For now I am wondering how best to map the current property to RO. I am thinking of making an RO ID property to RO:0002331 plus an equivalent property http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002331. Note that these are not strictly equivalent since the RO relation is more general and can apply, for example, to a traffic light that is involved-in the regulation of traffic. I have a related question here: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P1628#Semantics_-_when_should_this_be_used?
