== Why URL? ==

{{Ping|ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2|Dominikmatus|Trade|Eihel|Pintoch}} can any of you explain to me why you supported this property as being no external ID property? [[User:ChristianKl|<font color="#0000EE">'''ChristianKl'''</font>]] ❪[[User talk:ChristianKl|✉]]❫ 08:17, 8 October 2019 (UTC)

*{{re|ChristianKl}} I did not support it - I only created it based on the existing consensus. − [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:16, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
*:{{re|Pintoch}} I think we have the property creator flag based on the assumption that there are people commenting on property proposals that don't know things like the difference between URL and external ID's. Doing a check about whether the proposal makes sense or whether there are open issues seems to me an integral part of the task of creating new properties. Do you think that responsibility shouldn't be with the person who creates the property?

*::{{re|ChristianKl}} I reply yes, 100%. But I developed this proposal (and for someone else besides) knowing the difference between ID and URL ({{Diff|Page=Property talk:P7375|diff=1027998969|oldid=1027956032|label=see also my reply below, please}}). I consider myself, in all modesty, a very correct level for my status. I even help an admin to do his RegEx and I reread the multitude of proposals several times a week by proposing corrections (because I do not impinge on a proposal). Some of these corrections are accepted, but others are not (recalcitrant to the understanding). I often want to vote against some skeletal proposals or proposals with aberrations. But, I hold back and I keep the reason and I propose to do the same before making accusations. You have the opportunity to file [[Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Removal|an application]] to this effect. There are certainly other things to change in the problematic that you are advancing: the proposers and voters are not all enlightened like you, even in the admin (I do not target anyone), so there are proposals that "pass the course" by becoming Properties. It is characteristic of a heterogeneous community. {{Ping|Pintoch}} created on his Git a tool to create properties and nobody thought of generalizing that. Once I looked at the list of creators, there was only one third who regularly made new properties. When applying for PC status, I do not talk about it. That said, I congratulate you for all the properties you have created. —[[User:Eihel|Eihel]] ([[User talk:Eihel|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:31, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
*::{{re|ChristianKl}} yes, I typically check for datatype issues. In this case, because of the structure of the URL, it was not straightforward to convert it to an external-id. You could work something out with ArthurPSmith's proxy, but it is not clear that this is really desirable, since it would mean making up an id format that is not actually used anywhere else in the wild. You could also create multiple external-id properties for each subdomain, but it is not clear that it would be really better… {{tq|Doing a check about whether the proposal makes sense or whether there are open issues seems to me an integral part of the task of creating new properties. Do you think that responsibility shouldn't be with the person who creates the property?}} yes absolutely, and so in this case I do believe the proposal made sense. In this case Eihel was clearly aware of the alternatives, they proposed a URL datatype knowingly (so the creation as URL is not a mistake).  Because I suspected there would be people opposing this like you do now, I did not create the property 7 days after proposal and left a longer discussion period for it. So really, in this particular example I do not think I messed up… If you have strong feelings about external-id versus URL, this should have let you ample time to oppose the property in that state. As a property creator I try to create all properties for which there is a consensus, assuming there is no technical issue (such as inconsistent datatype), regardless of whether I personally like them or not. You can always nominate the property for deletion if you missed the discussion period. However if you want to bring up broader issues about my activity around property proposals, I would be happy to discuss that (perhaps on my talk page rather than here?) − [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:05, 9 October 2019 (UTC)
*:::{{re|ChristianKl}} just checking if you still have concerns about how this property was created? − [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:27, 11 October 2019 (UTC)
*I just tried having a look at one of the example in the proposal, http://glass.museumwnf.org/#/database-item/DGA/tr/Mus42/6/en − it does not resolve anymore and redirects to the home page. The correct URL is now http://glass.museumwnf.org/database-item/DGA/tr/Mus42/6/en.
:
:Digging more into the glass URLs, one of the first items I encounted is http://glass.museumwnf.org/database-item/EPM/dn/Mus21/12/en, which actually recommends to link to http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=object;EPM;dn;Mus21;12;en ; so it looks like that these URLs are not really stable, and that that the various websites, while not interchangeable, are at least to a certain degree frontends for the same underlying data.
:
:The proposal stated that “the catalog entry types are numerous”, but the examples given are only “object” and “monument”&nbsp;− so wouldn’t a “Object ID”&nbsp;and “Monument ID” be better?

*:As mentioned in the [[Wikidata:Property_proposal/mwnf|proposal discussion]], this property does not contain a constraint of type (catalog variety), but especially catalog entries can be found in several places in WD (some general objects). In addition, entries in this catalog are in other collections (virtual museum). The complexity of the URL means that the primary statement and the only remaining one is the URL contained in the RegEx (format constraint) and this property no longer looks like an usual identifier. So I chose URL for this property. As described in the [[Help:Data_type#URL|type explanation]], a URL type can serve as an identifier. That said, if your wish is that it is in the part ''Identifiers'', that also agrees to me.
*:
*:If I am not against {{re|ChristianKl}}, I {{strong oppose}} the opinion of {{re|Jean-Frédéric}}.
*:
*:So you found 2 of my entries in the catalog: object and building. Congratulations. So we agree on these 2 ''instances'' or ''subclass''. To which I add those I found:
*:*{{Q|Q2993475}} → [http://sharinghistory.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=object;AWE;pd;15;en;N], so instance of {{Q|Q5}}
*:*{{Q|Q193163}} → [http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;pa;Mon01;1;en&pageT=N], so instance of {{Q|Q17334923}} (as debate)
*:*There are even {{Q|Q17334923}} without construction: [http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;pt;Mon01;35;en&pageT=N], so {{Q|Q17334923}}.
*:In addition, following future MWNF partnerships, other ''instances'' may arise. As no one from WD scans each catalog, we have to plan wide.
*: 
*:For http://glass.museumwnf.org/#/database-item/DGA/tr/Mus42/6/en, I added the URL from the catalog search page, but the correct URL is without the '''#''', that is, http://glass.museumwnf.org/database-item/DGA/tr/Mus42/6/en. This is a bug on the site on themes (''glass'', for example), but the URLs are constant. In addition, depending on the operation of the museum (virtual exhibitions), other ''instances'' can be added. The RegEx being the "dam" to the misuse of the property. For all, I did my best to make a correct proposal. 
*:
*:{{Ping|Pintoch}} "[[Help:Properties#Editing_properties|Major changes to a property should be discussed on its talk page first]]", and [[Help:Data type#Changing datatype|a datatype can be changed by a sysadmin]]: "To propose such a change, you may start a discussion at the talk page of the property or project chat. After a consensus, a request may be made in [[Wikidata:Contact the development team]]". We may be against the proposal, but not against proposing: the properties are not engraved in the stone.
*:<small>Phew! I replied everyone</small>. Cordially. —[[User:Eihel|Eihel]] ([[User talk:Eihel|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:00, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
*::Thanks for the reply, and while I apologise if my question came across the wrong way, your “Congratulations” come across as snarky which I find a bit unwarranted to be honest.
*::My point was not so much about what {{property|P31}} the items should be ; but that (and granted, I could have been clearer) the URLs seem to either be <code><nowiki>database_item.php?id=monument;</nowiki></code> or  <code><nowiki>database_item.php?id=object;</nowiki></code> (including the two example you give above), hence my thought that these could map to two separate identifiers − I may well be wrong of course, as I have not done extensive research in this identifier. :-) [[User:Jean-Frédéric|Jean-Fred]] ([[User talk:Jean-Frédéric|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:14, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
*:::<div class="plainlinks">Hello {{re|Jean-Frédéric}},<br />URLs also start differently: there are different collections. Following ''museum.org/'' too, your URL portion may be ''thematicgallery'' instead of ''database_item'', as in [http://www.museumwnf.org/thematicgallery/thg_galleries/database_item.php?&id=GALLERIES;sw;Mus01;11;en&itemId=objects;GALLERIES;sw;Mus01;11;en this link]. ''database_item'' is further in the URL. You also find ''monument'' and ''object'', on this link you also have ''GALLERIES''. So it's not just your 2 solutions: everything is in the RegEx (hence the URL datatype). But the identifiers of museums and GLAM in general do not need a Property for each collection.

*What about asking the webmasters of that database if they could add unique ID to every object so it could be linked? [[User:Dominikmatus|Dominikmatus]] ([[User talk:Dominikmatus|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:52, 8 October 2019 (UTC)
