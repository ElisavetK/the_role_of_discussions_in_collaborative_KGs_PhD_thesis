The ICAA are listed on [[:w:Video game content rating system]]. Should i change the property to reflect this? {{Ping|Máté}}--[[User:Trade|Trade]] ([[User talk:Trade|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:30, 28 November 2020 (UTC)
:{{ping|Trade}} You sent me way off track by mentioning ICAA (the Spanish rating body) instead of INCAA :). In any case: I don't think so. The video game rating system seems to be entirely separate from this one. This system concerns only movies and is maintained by [http://www.incaa.gov.ar/caec CAEC] within INCAA. The video game rating was supposed to be done by an entirely different body (El Consejo Nacional de la Niñez, Adolescencia y la Familia) only in coordination with INCAA. I cannot, however, find any trace of the system ever actually launching. All sources I found are from 2005-2006 and are talking about a future system. No traces of the council either outside of the law that was supposed to establish it. The Argentinian government actually suggests parents consult PEGI.

'Before 2006, video games released in South Korea were rated by KMRB.'  Roughly [https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=kmrb 100] of those are listed on MobyGames. Should we change it? {{Ping|Máté}}--[[User:Trade|Trade]] ([[User talk:Trade|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:36, 28 November 2020 (UTC)
:{{ping|Trade}} That should be suggested on the talk page of that property. Currently there are editors who use it way more than I do. But I think a separate property would be a better solution. – [[User:Máté|Máté]] ([[User talk:Máté|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:40, 28 November 2020 (UTC)
{{Ping|Máté}} What did i do wrong since you reverted me? --[[User:Trade|Trade]] ([[User talk:Trade|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:46, 28 November 2020 (UTC)
