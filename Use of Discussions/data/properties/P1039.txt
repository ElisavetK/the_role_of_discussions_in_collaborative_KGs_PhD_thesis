== Which direction? ==

This qualifier property has room for confusion. With {{p|1038}} whould {{P|1039}} refer to what the object is to the subject (the item) or the other way round: what the subject is to the object. I have taken it to be the former case, so when it is stated on {{Q|22808000}} with {{P|1038}} and {{p|1039}} set to {{Q|3603531}} I mean that {{Q|22810614}} is the grandchild of {{Q|22808000}}. &mdash; [[User:Fnielsen|Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen)]] ([[User talk:Fnielsen|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:51, 20 February 2016 (UTC)

:{{ping|Micru}} you created the property. I agree with {{u|Fnielsen}} that the direction of the relationship is ambiguous. Can you please qualify this so their is clarity whether the relative qualifier is from the perspective of the page item, or whether it is the relative themself. For example, add person is the father-in-law, or the item occurs on the page of the father-in-law.

:::{{ping|billinghurst}} I would use whatever the person would say of his/her relative. If the person would say "person X is my aunt", then I would translate it as "type of kinship:aunt". Other properties like "brother", "sister", "father", etc. follow the same format.--[[User:Micru|Micru]] ([[User talk:Micru|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:21, 5 November 2016 (UTC)
:::: I also do believe that this property is prone to errors; like many Wikidata properties where nothing indicates clearly in a RDF point of view, if the modified item is the subject or the object of the triplet. Would it be possible to display under the property: X is grandfather of Y (where X is the modified item).

== Proposal for simplification: consistency, gender-neutrality and age-neutrality ==

Currently some relations are stored with a gender ({{Q|10861465}}, {{Q|2920422}}), some with a relative age ({{Q|28466210}}, {{Q|28466211}}), some with both ({{Q|10943095}}, {{Q|10885666}}) and some are stored without gender and age ({{Q|2500619}}, {{Q|402152}}, {{Q|23009870}}). I think it would be better if we would make this system consistent. I worked on this before, but I was told it would be a good idea to reach consensus first.

Currently there is also no argument against creating and using items like "younger male cousin", "elder paternal half-brother", "younger step-sister", etc.

I propose to convert all relationships to gender-neutral and age-neutral relationships, because age and gender are already stored in the person items, so storing it twice is unnecessarily, redundant and error-prone. This would be a task for a bot, which should also keep doing this in the future, to keep everything consistent. Before removing gender information, the bot should first check if the subject item has {{P|21}}, if it doesn't have it it should add it as to not lose data. The bot shouldn't remove "younger" or "elder" relationships if both items don't have {{P|569}}, otherwise data would be lost.

The following properties are already gender-neutral and age-neutral for this reason: {{P|3448}}, {{P|1290}}, {{P|26}}, {{P|451}} and {{P|40}}.

If we use gender-neutral items, we make the system easier for Wikipedias that want to use Wikidata. Wikipedias can theirself decide what kind of information (gender, age, etc.) they want to show. For example, take a look at this item {{Q|186304}} and [[:fr:Kim Kardashian|the linked French article]]. The Wikidata item only contains 4 half-siblings, but the French Wikipedia shows the gender for all 4 half-siblings. It uses {{P|3321}} and {{P|2521}} in {{Q|27965041}} to do this. {{User:Robin van der Vliet/Signature}} 14:57, 12 February 2017 (UTC)

** {{ping|billinghurst}} Why do you have a problem with gender-neutrality and not with age-neutrality? Wikidata is a project for everybody, not just Europeans. Do you think we also need "male cousin" and "female cousin"? Can you send me the link to the previous RFD, I don't remember seeing it. {{User:Robin van der Vliet/Signature}} 00:28, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
**:Trying to remember where it is, it was indirect discussion, so I cannot remember whether it was a property creation request to replace something in the relative or kinship component; or whether it was a broader conversation in project chat. I have been looking but time is against me at the moment. &nbsp;— [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''<span style="font-size:90%;">[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]</span>'' 00:50, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
**:Re commentary. For the male cousin and female cousin, I have no issue; whereas maternal cousin or paternal cousin are different; both are gender-related, whereas your proposal was about degendering 'full stop'. In many numbers of historical works there is mention of relationships of people, be that maternal step-father, paternal grandmother, or maternal grandmother, etc. This sourced accuracy should be recorded rather than blandly washed away due to some convenience that a superquery may be generated by one of the wikipedias. [I will note that not all the wikis have that skill-set to generate those queries and distinctions].  Sometimes works will specify that Person A had four brothers, with no mention of sisters (as deemed unimportant in that male hierarchical system) so to record something as 4 siblings is inaccurate. By the way have you consulted with local projects like the genealogy project about what is required with their data? I could see that you are proposing to remove that ability to link.<p>I have no issue with consistency, where there are errors or misuse should be more looking to fix the issues around the data entry; we should be given greater guidance; put in measures to stop unuseful relationships; removing gender-related is whitewashing data, and whitewashing sources; that is not our role, our role is to reflect the sources. Where they are stored with missing information, that is the nature of WD, many items are lacking full information, and it is our role to populate that information, not look to move down to the lower/lowest common denominator. We can only do what the sources give us. &nbsp;— [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''<span style="font-size:90%;">[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]</span>'' 01:46, 20 February 2017 (UTC)</p>
**::{{ping|billinghurst}}
**::"''whereas maternal cousin or paternal cousin are different''"
**::I meant "male cousin" and "female cousin", the actual genders of the cousins. I didn't propose to remove "paternal" and "maternal" relationships and removing that information, since that is information not stored in the target item. I proposed to remove the gender of the relationship, since it is already stored there.
**::"''so to record something as 4 siblings is inaccurate''"
**::Storing it like that isn't inaccurate, because all the items would still contain the following statement to store the gender: {{C||21|6581097}}
**::"''This sourced accuracy should be recorded rather than blandly washed away''"
**::If a news source uses the sentence [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22his+German+cousin%22 "his German cousin" (11,600 results)], should we then create an item called "German cousin", which would be a subclass of {{Q|42884}} and {{Q|Q23009870}}? What about [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22his+older+cousin%22 "his older cousin" (90,300 results)], it is even more popular on Google? I suppose we should then, instead of blandly washing away a sourced accuracy... Why is gender so important, when nationality and age are not?
**::Gender, nationality and age are all things that should only be stored in the property. This property should only record the kind of relationship, not some random properties about the subject.
**::{{User:Robin van der Vliet/Signature}} 02:08, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
**:::Be wary with examples as a german-cousin has nothing to do with a German cousin. Such a relationship is often mentioned in biographical works and I would expect that to be mentioned.<p>With regard to gender-less relationships, direct relationships should always have gender. Maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather should be explicit, as was determined for father and mother. It is simply too much work to have to dig for gender when the explicit and clear relationship exists. &nbsp;— [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''<span style="font-size:90%;">[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]</span>'' 03:48, 21 February 2017 (UTC)</p>
**::::addendum. No where have I said that nationality was pertinent; I believe that in my first statement that I said that age neutrality was okay. So please don't foist those arguments to present your case. The genealogical information is important, and the more that it is neutered, or harder to reference, the harder it becomes to withdraw, or check when visiting items. The loss of "brother/sister" converted to sibling means that on one example where family member names had non-overt gender, I had to open some of the names to do the count and gender matching. Sure that was unusual, but it is a consequence of these "simplification" measures. &nbsp;— [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''<span style="font-size:90%;">[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]</span>'' 04:08, 21 February 2017 (UTC)

* Mild {{oppose}}.  The proposer assumes that "age and gender are already stored in the person items", but for data about historical people, we cannot assume we know their date of birth.

** {{ping|Jheald}} It is of course not my intention to lose data. Before removing gender information, it should add {{P|21}} to the subject if it is not already there. And it should also only remove "younger"/"older" if both items have {{P|569}}. I expanded on this part in the proposal. What do you now think of it? {{User:Robin van der Vliet/Signature}} 15:28, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
**:I can see that without dates of birth that we can use "serial ordinal" thought that presumes that one of the parents is within the system.

***:Yeah, a use case would be good to see. <br>I tend to agree with billinghurst/sDrewth about the "German" cousin question: if a reference mentions one as such, a corresponding statement should reflect this with {{P|1038}}. As already noticed on [[Property talk:P3373]], there may be some language barrier involved: What might be para-phrased in English with (e.g.) "his older cousin" might match a precise term in some other language source. <br> If the family tree is available on Wikidata (and it doesn't involve much uncertainty), I don't see a point in adding {{P|1038}}.  <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 12:56, 25 February 2017 (UTC)

== nephew/niece in Chinese/Japanese ==

I noticed that {{Q|15224724}} has the same labels in Chinese and Japanese (甥), as well as {{Q|3403377}} (姪). Although both languages use the same {{Q|8201}}/{{Q|82772}}, the meanings are actually different. In Japanese, 甥 (おい) means a son of one's sibling. However, in Chinese 甥 means a child of one's sister, or more specifically a son of one's sister (in such case 甥女 means a daughter of one's sister). Similarly, in Japanese 姪 (めい) means a daughter of one's sibling, but in Chinese 姪 means a child of one's brother or more specifically a son of one's brother (in such case 姪女 means a daughter of one's brother).

I'm wondering how should we deal with this? I find that the definitions in Japanese are in line with other languages. So should we create new items for the Chinese definitions? --[[User:Stevenliuyi|Stevenliuyi]] ([[User talk:Stevenliuyi|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:45, 10 January 2018 (UTC)
*There are a series of different relationship terms at [[Wikidata:WikiProject Parenthood/lists/kinship types]]. If you set the interface language to Chinese or Japanese, the yellow column will show the terms/definitions in these languages. The column before is the same in English. Please help correct them if needed. If there are relationships terms that are missing, don't hesitate to create new items for these. We can then try to complete the other info. <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 09:56, 10 January 2018 (UTC)
