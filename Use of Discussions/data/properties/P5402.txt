may be to limit to the same language? Otherwise we end up with hundreds of cross-links in each of hundreds interlanguage homographs (see e.g. [[wikt:ru:Peru]]). --[[User:Infovarius|Infovarius]] ([[User talk:Infovarius|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:30, 19 October 2018 (UTC)
: I agree it should be limited to the same language. The [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Property_proposal/homograph_lexeme&diff=next&oldid=684841939 only support] in property proposal was also in the same language.

: Agree: when editing lexemes, it's fairly important to bear in mind homograph ones in the same language. We could add [[template:complex constraint|complex constraint]] to monitor this.  --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 09:24, 19 October 2018 (UTC)
: I also think it should be limited to the same language. -[[User:Theklan|Theklan]] ([[User talk:Theklan|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:36, 12 November 2019 (UTC)

::: I've edited all the descriptions except Finnish and created [[phab:T271079]] asking for a "same language" constraint. In the meantime I've added a complex constraint ([[Database reports/Complex constraint violations/P5402]]) although I won't know if it's worked until the report has been generated. I don't know when that will be so I also made a Listeria list ([[User:Nikki/P5402]]). - [[User:Nikki|Nikki]] ([[User talk:Nikki|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 23:35, 3 January 2021 (UTC)
::::Thanks. If you click on the "violations query", you get what the constraint report should output. Ideally {{Q|Q1321}} and {{Q|Q736236}} would probably also be considered the same language by the constraint. --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 23:40, 3 January 2021 (UTC)
