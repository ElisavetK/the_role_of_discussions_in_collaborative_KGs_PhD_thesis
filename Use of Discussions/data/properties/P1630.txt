Please do not use URLs like "//www.freebase.com". Use "https://www.freebase.com" instead. "//" is Wikimedia`s invention as I know. But this property will be used by external users too.

In addition, a URI reference (Section 4.1) may be a relative-path reference, in which case the first path segment cannot contain a colon (":") character.''"   This does not suggests that relative paths may begin with two slashes; other sections about relative references ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1 section 5.1]) also do not show a path starting with two slashes either.

== Handling of qualifiers ==

I noticed that the properties examples given for [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Property:P1900&oldid=221790198 P1900] do not show proper URL formatting and thus played around with it [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q4115189&type=revision&diff=230549222&oldid=230535268 in the sandbox], which suggests that the formatting works fine for statements but not qualifiers. Don't know how to fix that. --[[User:Daniel Mietchen|Daniel Mietchen]] ([[User talk:Daniel Mietchen|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:00, 14 July 2015 (UTC)

== $ ==

And what should we do with the formatter URL's on {{P|679}} and {{P|2062}} which have $ in the URL. --[[User:Pasleim|Pasleim]] ([[User talk:Pasleim|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:54, 28 September 2015 (UTC)

== Qualifier {{P|1535}} = {{Q|22348290}} ==

== Dofollow links to proprietary and for-profit targets ==

{{tracked|T175230}}
I discovered today that [[phabricator:T175230|Wikidata identifier links don't respect nofollow configuration]]. I wonder if users knew this when they set certain IDs to link for-profit, proprietary websites. --[[User:Nemo_bis|Nemo]] 06:01, 7 September 2017 (UTC)

== Distinct values constraint ==

This property has correctly the constraint "Distinct values". Recently two properties has been created with the same URL formatter: {{P|P4767}} and {{P|P4768}}. This doesn't make sense for me and I think they should be merged. Indeed for the website www.cinematografo.it there is no way for representing a company and a person with the same ID, instead we can, allowing P4767 and P4768 in the same item, that it's wrong. --[[User:Rotpunkt|Rotpunkt]] ([[User talk:Rotpunkt|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:02, 23 January 2018 (UTC)
: It's a nonmandatory constraint. We use nonmandatory constrains when most of the values are expected to not violate the constraint.

*Sure, I’ve no objections to merging the two.

== Using from within WDQS ==

A rather nice code fragment from [[User:Multichill]] for using this within a WDQS query:

{{SPARQL|query=

  BIND(IRI(REPLACE(?value,  CONCAT('(',?value,')'), ?fmt)) AS ?url) .

  wd:Pnnn wdt:P1630 ?fmt .
  BIND(IRI(REPLACE(?fmt, '\\$1'  , ?value)) AS ?url) .

==Removing advice on use of wd in URLs==
After a [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Project_chat&oldid=597260313#Random_URL_parts short discussion], [[User:Thierry Caro]] added the following advice to this property: "You may use 'wd' whenever some part of the URL is needed but can be randomly set without breaking the link.". 

[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P4931#Formatter Elsewhere] it's been pointed out that this is possibly harmful from a privacy POV; it in effect stamps URLs as 'from wikidata', for no obviously good reason, and frustrates the intentions of users whose user agents do not send an HTTP referer ID.

I'd like us to change the advice such that we use a more neutral string. I appreciate the whole issue is somewhat marginal, but still... --[[User:Tagishsimon|Tagishsimon]] ([[User talk:Tagishsimon|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:35, 29 April 2018 (UTC)

: Does Wikidata have a policy for [[w:Wikipedia:External links#referral|affiliate, tracking, or referral]] links?

== Varying URL ==

The National Academy of Sciences helpfully changes the URLs for deceased members, without leaving a redirect. E.g., {{Q|310067}} is at http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/8899.html, but the formatter on {{P|5380}} goes to http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/8899.html. I assume there's no way to fix it, short of changing all the identifiers to something like "deceased-members/8899"? [[User:Ghouston|Ghouston]] ([[User talk:Ghouston|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 05:18, 14 August 2018 (UTC)

== Alternative URL's based on regex match ==

I noticed that in cases where a property has multiple formatter URL's based on a regex match, the selection doesn't actually work.

E.g. in {{P|P791}}, the first alternative in the list is for DE-.*, and it works correctly ({{Q|Q27901}}). But as far I can see, the other alternatives don't actually format the URL if there's a match, e.g. US-.* in {{Q|Q131454}}, JP-.* in {{Q|Q61901152}} or IT-.* in {{Q|Q3639588}}. How is it supposed to work? --[[User:Alicia Fagerving (WMSE)|Alicia Fagerving (WMSE)]] ([[User talk:Alicia Fagerving (WMSE)|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:18, 27 June 2019 (UTC)
*Those aren't defined in [[MediaWiki:Gadget-AuthorityControl.js]] yet. --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 17:49, 27 June 2019 (UTC)

== Escaping special characters ==

{{q|Q16001236}} has a {{p|P373}} of "99% Invisible", which produces this broken URL: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:99%%20Invisible. The correct URL is https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:99%25%20Invisible, i.e. with % escaped to %25.

This URL would work, however: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?action=view&title=Category:99%%20Invisible — with the exact same string as a query parameter instead of a path segment.

Should the formatter URL of commons category be changed (since it works in this ''particular'' case)? Or does formatter URL need to learn how to provide url-safe variants of $1? --[[user:jleedev|jleedev]] ([[user talk:jleedev|talk]]) 20:54, 18 September 2019 (UTC)
: I'd say the % character should be escaped when converting to a URL, and this would affect other properties besides P373. [[User:Ghouston|Ghouston]] ([[User talk:Ghouston|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 02:46, 19 September 2019 (UTC)

== How to add the formatter URL if two different language versions have different url? ==

How to add the formatter URL If two languages have different URLs and both are the main sources. Should only one must been added to the property {{P-|1630}}.

== Escaping spaces to _ instead of + ==

[[Property:P2000]] was originally defined as data type '''String''', and was recently changed to data type '''External identifier'''. With that change, the formatter URL is no longer working, because now it converts any space in the parameter $1 into a + sign instead of an underscore (or a space, %20). How can I fix this? —[[User:Capmo|''capmo'']] ''([[User talk:Capmo|<span class="signature-talk">talk</span>]])'' 15:25, 23 March 2020 (UTC)
: Yes, I think the '+' escape can be used in forms, but not always in URLs, where %20 is correct. I suppose it's under the control of software and needs to be raised on Phabricator.

== External identifier with two parameters ==

Hi, could i create external identifier which has two parameters? We are created {{P|P8752}}, but only for one digital library. In the Czech Republic we have more digital libraries with same identifier style. Some in same url of https://www.digitalniknihovna.cz/$2, where $2 is digital library code. Some on different URLs. And result with one external identifier (with UUID of scan and code of library) will be helpfull, but i don't know how to do. [[User:Skim|Skim]] ([[User talk:Skim|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:50, 29 October 2020 (UTC)
: I don't think that this is possible directly, since the link is created by passing a single statement value to the formatter, substituting $1. The Usual alternative would be to create a separate property for each digital library. There's another method which could be used in theory, which is to use a property value which combines all of the information (library id and item id), and with a url formatter which goes to a custom service on Toolforge which would redirect to the right location.
