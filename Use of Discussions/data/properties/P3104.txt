== Relation to station identifiers used in SNCF tickets? ==
SNCF ticket barcodes contain station codes in this format too, however they seem to have a slightly broader scope (or rather, this property seems to be a strict subset of what can be found in SNCF tickets):
* There are codes for stations beyond what the formatter URL for this property can handle, see e.g. https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/referentiel-gares-voyageurs/table/?sort=gare_alias_libelle_noncontraint (which has the codes without the FR country prefix).
* There are international codes in those tickets as well, e.g. "CHGVA" for Geneva or "ESBST" for Barcelona, see also https://github.com/trainline-eu/stations/blob/master/stations.csv (sncf_id column).
* These codes are typically written in upper case (but that's really a minor difference).

How should this be handled, by relaxing the constraints on this property, or by adding a new property?

:Hi, this property are only to be used with the formater url https://www.garesetconnexions.sncf/fr/gare/$1 , on https://ressources.data.sncf.com/ they don't have this id and CHGVA and ESBST don't work, upper or lower.
:So to use it we would have to create another property (but with which url ?) — [[User:Eru|eru]] <sup>&#91;[[User_talk:Eru|Talk]]&#93; &#91;[[:fr:Utilisateur:Eru|french wiki]]&#93;</sup> 18:19, 13 February 2020 (UTC)

:: Thanks, makes sense. I am not aware of a formatter URL for the SNCF IDs (nor the very similar Benerail ones) unfortunately, I mainly need this to map from ticket data containing those ids to the station items. I'll look into proposing new properties then.
