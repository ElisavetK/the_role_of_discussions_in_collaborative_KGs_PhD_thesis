Despite the URL path, https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18054949/ is an identifier for Yale University. This authority control identifier is therefore also used for organizations. I have updated the constraints accordingly. <small>&nbsp;&ndash; {{Autotranslate|base=Unsigned/text|1=Runner1928|2=17:51, 14 September 2015â€Ž }}</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->
:The page didn't contain any constraints. I added a couple of them to see what it returns. [[User:Multichill|Multichill]] ([[User talk:Multichill|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:42, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
::The constraints throw errors for companies/organizations on date of birth, occupation, etc.  I suggest these constraints either be removed or changed to the new "flag"/suggestion constraint type when that becomes available. - [[User:PKM|PKM]] ([[User talk:PKM|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:21, 22 April 2019 (UTC)

: 3 constraint violations are reported for IBM: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37156#P2011: no occupation, birth, death. I'll remove these constraints: unless they can be made conditional on the entity type, they're more harm then good. cc {{ping|PKM|Multichill|Runner1928}} --[[User:Vladimir Alexiev|Vladimir Alexiev]] ([[User talk:Vladimir Alexiev|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 07:46, 27 April 2019 (UTC)

:::-1 would have been better to keep it and add exceptions or change the rank to suggested. [[User:Multichill|Multichill]] ([[User talk:Multichill|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:12, 30 April 2019 (UTC)
:::: {{ping|Multichill}} Add exceptions? Of the first 35 on the first page on MnM https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/#/list/83/unmatched, the following 19 are not people. Just because the URL says "people" doesn't make it true. --[[User:Vladimir Alexiev|Vladimir Alexiev]] ([[User talk:Vladimir Alexiev|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:01, 1 May 2019 (UTC)
