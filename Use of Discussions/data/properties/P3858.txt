== There should be an inverse property to this ==

I've now added this property to most railways in Norway, but I find it a bit odd to only have a one-way connection, so we need an inverse property. I see that it was mentioned in the property proposal back then, but nothing seems to have happened since then. But I'm not sure if we actually need to have a new property only for that purpose. Since {{P|3858}} is set as a subproperty of {{P|1424}}, then can't we just use {{P|1423}}? I tried this at one item, and it now has a inverse constraints issue, but wouldn't just fixing the constraints fix this? Or could there be some logical problem related to use P1423 for this purpose?

Also, I could probably go through the same RDTs and add this property if it is okay to use P1423, but could this be done by a bot? It seems to me like a relatively small botjob that can't go very much wrong. (But I could be wrong too!) Anyhow, I have no knowledge of bots (and don't intend to learn it either), so if this should be done by a bot, someone else has to do it.
