Hi

{{ping|Jura1|NMaia|Paperoastro}}

FYI, I removed the class {{Q|79007}} as it's already a subclass of {{Q|83620}} (see [[Special:Diff/1291368641]]).

Also, since 2 thoroughfares are parallel when they have (at least) 2 other thoroughfares in common via {{P|47}} (per basic geometry) I wonder if we can built a complexe constraint and/or should automatically populate this property since we already have the information with {{P|47}} (or {{P|2789}}, the model is not consistent on that point).

WDYT?
