{{Ping|Multichill|Hannolans|99of9|ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2}} Hello. This is broken. How can we have this work again using only the language-independent numeric ID only? Do you have any idea?

:I sent an email to the person who is working on the collection system. She is now in contact with the web builders as they also prefer to have a direct link with the objectID. Hope to hear more soon --[[User:Hannolans|Hannolans]] ([[User talk:Hannolans|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:12, 20 December 2018 (UTC)
::{{Ping|Hannolans}} Hi. Can you put some kind of friendly pressure on them? [[User:Thierry Caro|Thierry Caro]] ([[User talk:Thierry Caro|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:26, 19 January 2019 (UTC)
:::Yes, I some hours ago I sent them a reminder. Some of their own website pages are broken as well. Hope they reply if and how they will fix it. --[[User:Hannolans|Hannolans]] ([[User talk:Hannolans|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:52, 19 January 2019 (UTC)
::::Talked with Laura Morison - data manager TMS Museum Boijmans - this week. The change to the old links is approved in the backlog for the webbuilders and it will be altered. We don't have to change the links she assured. It will take a while as there are more issues to implement. The change also broke their own links in articles. --[[User:Hannolans|Hannolans]] ([[User talk:Hannolans|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:49, 2 February 2019 (UTC)
