== links no longer valid ==

Beware, not only have external links changed but they also have now two different ones, depending on if it's a compound or a class:
* compound: http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/LMSDRecord.php?LMID=LMGP04010000
* class: http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/LMSDSearch.php?Mode=ProcessClassSearch&LMID=LMGP04
Generally searching for class ids does NOT work.

So we need two properties. I'm changing this one to work at least with compounds. --[[User:SCIdude|SCIdude]] ([[User talk:SCIdude|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:44, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
