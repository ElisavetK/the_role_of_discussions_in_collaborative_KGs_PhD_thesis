== Usage for non-railways ==

Hey everyone,
there was a question in the Wikidata telegram group about a property for bus lines. Given that this property is already in use for rail lines, i think it would make much sense to use it for any kind of public transport line, including bus, metro and tram transport. I've updated the labels and descriptions in English and Dutch. The constraint for subclasses of {{Q|Q1067164}} was already available, so that needs no updating.

This is a good suggestion. --[[User:Akbarali|Akbarali]] ([[User talk:Akbarali|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:03, 2 March 2020 (UTC)
