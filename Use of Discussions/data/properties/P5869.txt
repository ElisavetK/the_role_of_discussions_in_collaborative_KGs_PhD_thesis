Thanks {{ping|Jura1}}, I think its probably sensible to have the discussion here as the project chat will get archived, I've copied your message on project chat as a quote above and left a message there to come discuss here. I have one comment and two questions: 

Comment: {{ping|NavinoEvans}} has kindly pointed to [[Property_talk:P463#Only_persons?]] which shows that properties have previously expanded in scope so it seems as though there is no restriction to expanding the use of a property beyond people's agreement (e.g you don't have to do the property proposal again). 

Two questions

# I don't understand why you say that the proposed invese property would not be usable on properties, can you explain further? 

# when you say ''if selection is mainly done by the number of statements on an item, the query links on the property talk page are better than a static link to one item'' Im not sure I understand, could you use an example?

Thanks again
