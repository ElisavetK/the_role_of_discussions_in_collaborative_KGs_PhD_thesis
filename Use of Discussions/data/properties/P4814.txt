{{Ping|Sadads}} to [https://twitter.com/sadads/status/1000398076497055744 continue this], I browsed around a bit on this site. Take for example the [https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1527V86X07D42.1386&profile=ariall&uri=link=3100011~!199727~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=Browse&menu=search&ri=2&source=~!siartinventories&term=Smithsonian+American+Art+Museum%2C+Washington%2C+District+of+Columbia&index=OWNER SAAM works], that's over 8000 of them and we already have most of these. I'm sure a lot of the other American collections we already added to Wikidata will give a lot of hits. Looking at https://library.si.edu/data they already publish some open data. Maybe you can ask around what the plans are with this data set? If it's open, it's much easier to process and cross reference.

:{{ping|Sarasays}} do you have a sense if we could get the set as a set? Seems like there is interest for uploading it. [[User:Sadads|Sadads]] ([[User talk:Sadads|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:40, 31 May 2018 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Sadads|Sarasays|Multichill}} - I just asked Sara IRL whether this is a possibility and she sent an inquiry about it to her Smithsonian colleagues. Will let you know if we hear back. Thanks. -- [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] ([[User talk:Fuzheado|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:23, 17 February 2019 (UTC)
::: I completely forgot about this property [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]]. Looks like it's about [https://americanart.si.edu/research/inventories 400.000] records. Would be great to have that as open data! While clicking around I noticed http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=&fq=object_type%3A%22Paintings%22 and it also seems to be included there. How does this relate to http://americanartcollaborative.org/ ? I still see some activity on https://github.com/american-art , but not that much.

== Constraint needs modding ==

The regular expression constraint should be modified as an ID with a two letter region code also seems legit. Example: 	IAS DC000139 -- [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] ([[User talk:Fuzheado|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:36, 17 February 2019 (UTC)
:Agree; I added another 'exception' because I don't know regex, but anyway it seems to be part of the schema. [[User:Arlo Barnes|Arlo Barnes]] ([[User talk:Arlo Barnes|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:53, 18 October 2020 (UTC)
::I believe I have now fixed the format constraint, so I removed the two exceptions that were marked. This seems to be an ordinary part of how they do identifiers, rather than just a few weird ones.
