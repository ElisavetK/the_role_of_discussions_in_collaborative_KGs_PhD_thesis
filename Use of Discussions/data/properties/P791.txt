== Formatter URL doesn't work well ==

Hi, I noticed that the URL chosen for this property works only with ISIL codes associated with Germany, but it doesn't work with, say, Italy or Switzerland. I think it would be better to remove the URL, since there is a search engine for every country that adhere to ISIL standard. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 18:19, 5 April 2015 (UTC)
: I agree, otherwise the "International" in ISIL seems overly limited. --[[User:Steko|Steko]] ([[User talk:Steko|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:56, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

:Just encountering the same issue for Danish Libraries. The alternative to remove the Formatter URL, would be to have several Formatter URL and then qualify them with Country? --[[User:VicVal|VicVal]] ([[User talk:VicVal|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:22, 19 November 2015 (UTC)

== New Formatter URL ==

Dear administrators!

Please consider to change the Formatter URL from http://dispatch.opac.d-nb.de/DB=1.2/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=8529&TRM=$1 to https://w3id.org/isil/$1 with a value (?:DE|ZDB|US|IT|JP)-.* for the "format as a regular expression" property. Since I'm not allowed to change this.

This way not only German but also US, Italian and Japan ISILs will be linked.

*That seems problematic as it's a third party redirect service. We can add more in the gadget instead. BTW, even if it's added, former information shouldn't be overwritten. <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 12:14, 28 November 2017 (UTC)
::Up until now, only DE-* codes were allowed to function, because for some reason a Germany-only URL was provided for a service that's supposed to be international. It's a redirect, I know, but at least it works.
::Moreover, {{P|1630}} only allows for ''one'' value. Keeping the others as "deprecated" or using the gadget doesn't seem to me a good idea.

:As the regex aren't supported yet for external-ids, I deprecated the formatter urls. The gadget will  continue to provide the links .. {{ping|Pyrog}} for info.

== Change of datatype ==
=== Data type "external identifier"? ===
Hi,
I was wondering why this property isn't defined to expect the data type "external identifier" (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Data_type#External_identifier). Wouldn't that fit?

=== Proposal - Change [[Help:Data_type|Data type]] of {{P|791}} from {{Datatype|string}} to {{Datatype|external-id}} ===

=== Proposal - Change from "Statements" to "Identifiers" ===
This property is sorted in "Statements" but it is in identifiers. Thus, it should be sorted in the section "Identifier".

See for example {{Q|131454}}: The property {{P|791}} belongs to the chapter "Statement". --[[User:Eulenspiegel1|Eulenspiegel1]] ([[User talk:Eulenspiegel1|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 23:12, 4 March 2020 (UTC)

== Removal of single value constraint ==

Currently {{St|P791|P2302|Q19474404}}. The problem is that ISIL does not make this guarantee: {{Quote box|quote  = 
Since this document allows the use of existing codes to be incorporated into the ISIL, it is possible that a given organization can have more than one ISIL. However, it is the intention of this document to minimize the number of codes.
|source=[https://www.iso.org/standard/77849.html ISO 15511:2019]
}}

I guess the right solution is to remove the constraint. Please discuss below. [[User:Iwan.Aucamp|Iwan.Aucamp]] ([[User talk:Iwan.Aucamp|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:44, 30 April 2020 (UTC)

== Again on {{P|1630}} ==
It so happens that we have found a way to give access to all national sub-catalogues for libraries with the address https://w3id.org/isil/$1, that automatically redirects users to the particular national website.

My proposal is to remove all other formatter URLs, since they cannot work with current datatype and, given the solution provided by a {{Q|37033}} group, they might induce people to add a potentially infinite list of links that are to be considered deprecated on Wikidata. --[[User:Sannita|Sannita]] - <small>''[[User talk:Sannita|not just another it.wiki sysop]]''</small> 10:28, 6 May 2020 (UTC)

:Thanks for the ping. So, I think that https://w3id.org/isil/$1 works for most, but not all the IDs: e.g. https://w3id.org/isil/RU-10017011 (one of the examples) seems not working. I've already set some days ago the {{P|1630}} https://w3id.org/isil/$1 as preferred value, but strangely the property displays no link (maybe a bug?). While I agree about removing formatter URLs starting with https://w3id.org/isil/$1, I'm not so sure about totally removing the other ones, which I think are correct and worth mentioning; probably they should be moved to {{P|3303}}, although I'm not sure an URL like http://anagrafe.iccu.sbn.it/isil/$1 can be considered "third party". Anyway, I'm convinced that in the present situation, with https://w3id.org/isil/$1 setted as preferred value for {{P|1630}}, the link should already appear. --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style="color:green">'''dosis'''</span>]] 10:39, 6 May 2020 (UTC)
