Different_Language_Wikipedia_Article_Conflicts_for_Game_"Dandy"
There is a video game called "Dandy" that was released in 1983 for the Atari 8-bit line of computers, and then was substantially altered version and released for other platforms in 1986. The versions were different enough that the game database MobyGames lists the versions under separate articles. The English Wikipedia article for the video game Dandy (Q5215764) focuses primarily on the 1983 version but also lists the platforms it was later released on and only mentions the later versions in a single sentence under the section "Legacy". In contrast, the Italian Wikipedia article describes only the 1986 version and mentions that it is based on the 1983 version, which is linked to as [4], an article that doesn't exist.
My question is, since the English article is about both versions of the game, should the Wikidata item for the English article Dandy (Q5215764) contain a duplicate of all of the information from the Wikidata item for the Italian article Dandy (Q25409308), including database identifiers that are supposed to be unique? Is there a standard policy for when the content in Wikipedia articles for different languages doesn't line up and causes conflicts/redundancies like this?

I think the enwiki article is about the 1983 version. The other versions are only mentioned briefly in the "legacy" section. It's like en:Barack Obama which is about Barack Obama despite having a "legacy" section that mentions other things. Ghouston (talk) 06:18, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
@Ghouston: I think you are right that the article is mostly about the 1983 version. An issue I see is that the platform and release date in the infobox on the right include the information for both versions. Should the Wikidata item Dandy (Q5215764) for this article exclude information about the later version in its platform and release date sections? And do you have a recommendation for what property to use to link this item with the item Dandy (Q25409308) for the second version, based on the Italian article? Perhaps modified version of (P5059)?

In general, the Wikidata item should be about a coherent thing in the world, more than about a Wikipedia article (which is bound to evolve over time anyway). So I would think Dandy (Q5215764) should exclude information about the later version, but it can use followed by (P156) or replaced by (P1366) to refer to the distinct item for the later release. - Jmabel (talk) 20:35, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
@Jmabel: Thank you Jmabel, that makes sense. Rampagingcarrot (talk) 22:20, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
@Rampagingcarrot: I usually use based on (P144) to link the second item to the first in such cases. Jean-Fred (talk) 22:52, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
Huh, realising only now − I had sorted  out already both of these items back in June :-þ Jean-Fred (talk) 23:04, 10 August 2018 (UTC)
@Jean-Frédéric: Haha yes I did see you but wasn't sure if you had made the connection between the two! Rampagingcarrot (talk) 00:18, 11 August 2018 (UTC)
