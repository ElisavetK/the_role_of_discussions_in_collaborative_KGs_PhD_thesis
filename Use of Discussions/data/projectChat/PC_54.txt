Dams
Hello. I want to discuss the structure of items of dam (Q12323).
1) Do all items must have instance of (P31)->dam (Q12323)?
2) How to show the type of the dam according to its structure? Please read w:el:Dam#Types of dams. It's not so clear, but it says the types of the dams. We have:
a) arch dam (Q890545)
b) gravity dam (Q3497167)
c) arch-gravity dam (Q357679)
d) barrage (Q350495)
e) embankment dam (Q1244922)
f) rock-fill dam (Q11350418) (and concrete-face rock-fill dam (Q20180822))
g) earth-fill dam (Q11285593)
It's confusing because some items are about the shape and some about the materials. In wikidata we have that rock-fill dam (Q11350418) and earth-fill dam (Q11285593) are subclass of (P279) of embankment dam (Q1244922). But Wikipedia article don't. There is also dome dam (Q56631985).

IMO:
yes
I think that rock-fill dam (Q11350418) and earth-fill dam (Q11285593) will be always poor stubs. Only one stub, in Japanese, exists among these two topics ! Such articles should be merged inside embankment dam (Q1244922). Best solution, for me : put every thing as a subclass of (P279) of dam (Q12323). More eover, shape and material are always closely linked.
Please also notice beaver dam (Q4878217) and all topic related with it... Borvan53 (talk) 12:32, 18 January 2020 (UTC)
But how we are going to add the information about the shape and material? Xaris333 (talk) 14:18, 18 January 2020 (UTC)

 Also a dam
Don't forget that things like Oosterscheldekering (Q1893089) are dams too (and Dam Square (Q839050) used to be one). They whole waterworks ontology here seems to be a bit messy. A dam is a divider with water on both sides. So Longitudinal control dam (Q1816121) is a dam to ("strekdam" in Dutch) and breakwater (Q215635) often too. The current description of dam (Q12323) doesn't seem to cover this.  Multichill (talk) 17:44, 18 January 2020 (UTC)
Another dead end in Wikidata. The mess will continue. Xaris333 (talk) 11:05, 19 January 2020 (UTC)
This is type of dam in ja-wiki. Classification by Japan Dam Foundation.

concrete dam (Q11302949) should have a statement with made from material (P186) = concrete (Q22657) otherwise it can't be queried. --- Jura 08:31, 20 January 2020 (UTC)
