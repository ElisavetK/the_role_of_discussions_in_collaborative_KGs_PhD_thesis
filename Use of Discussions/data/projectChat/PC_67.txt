Mrs Carolyn Wilson Harris was a member of the "Sullivant Moss Society", a society later renamed to something more officious. It was named after "William Starling Sullivant". This is a great example where we actually fail to provide proper information. Every potential way of having this information in Wikidata will be a hack. NB I hope to be proven wrong.

It's similar attributing specialized forms of occupation (P106) to Carl Linnaeus (Q1043) which did not exist at that time. :) --Succu (talk) 19:01, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
How is it similar? This society had a name that referred to a person. They renamed the organisation, functionally it is the same organisation and there is no way to refer properly to the person the organisation was named after. When Carl von Linne is considered to be a bryologist, fine it is stupid but acceptable as he did the works. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 19:26, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
It's the timeframe in question when a statement is regarded as "true". Linné worked about some cryptogam (Q333458). --Succu (talk) 19:33, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
That's not an issue at all. Apply the old name using native label (P1705) (or name in native language (P1559), with relaxed constraints) with a end time (P582) qualifier and a named after (P138) qualifier for the "William Starling Sullivant" biographical item. It only becomes an issue if you try to "shoehorn" (force) P138 as a statement at item level. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:06, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
This is what I would do.  In fact, I'd say we should identify two cases: (1) An item was formerly <named after>, in which case we list all "native names" each with a start and end time, named after (as appropriate), named by (as appropriate); and {2) An item is currently named after someone, in which case we list all "native names" each with a start and end time, named after (as appropriate), named by (as appropriate) but also use P138 as a statement at the item level, since it currently applies.  This doesn't bother me as redundant. - PKM (talk) 20:47, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
It's easy: create a new item for the Sullivant Moss Society. Then connect it to American Bryological and Lichenological Society (Q4064245) via followed by (P156) and add named after (P138)=William Starling Sullivant (Q1343134) to the new item. --Succu (talk) 20:22, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
That is not the correct action, if - as suggested by the OP - all that has happened is a name change. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:19, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
OP, Mr. Mabbett? Please be more talkative. --Succu (talk) 21:31, 9 July 2017 (UTC)
Please Andy, you are selective in your responses and where you reply. With a new item it shows correctly on the members of the "old" organisation. It has the added benefit that with a merger the parts are individually known and it is possible to establish those who founded it. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 06:20, 10 July 2017 (UTC)
I'm saddened that you resort to ad hominem; but where have I not replied, that you would like me to? I cannot parse "With a new item it shows correctly on the members of the "old" organisation" - what does that mean? As to the founder of the organisation, we have founded by (P112).

When you call me out for not answering your questions / concerns when I have already done so. When you think I am not aware by "founded by", it is not applicable and I use it almost every day. What can I say. You obviously do not understand the issues here. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 17:40, 10 July 2017 (UTC)
