Broaden_the_scope_of_P358
After the discussion above about bibliography links, I've opened up a discussion on Property talk:P358 about broadening the scope of discography (P358) to also include bibliographies, filmographies and similar lists instead of creating new properties for each. I've fleshed out my arguments there and have had two comments in support, but would like to hear from more people before going ahead. VÃ¤sk (talk) 11:23, 7 August 2014 (UTC)
