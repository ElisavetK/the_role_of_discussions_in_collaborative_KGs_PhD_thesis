Math is a language, and math symbols (science symbols in general) behaves a lot like lexemes:

the same symbol can mean a lot of different things, each one would be considered a different sense;
some properties used to describe mathematical symbols would be more appropriate as properties for lexemes (for example, Unicode character (P487) and TeX string (P1993)).
Furthermore, it could help to add semantics to mathematical formulas. I don't know if it viable but I think to something like the formulas in excel: selecting the right symbol senses from a dropdown menu in prefix notation.
For example, to write the equation "a=b+c" one types "=" and it is presented with all the senses of the "=" symbol; he select the most appropriate one, then Wikidata presents the syntax of the "=" operator, i.e. two operands; the user inserts "a" and it selects the sense "variable", then it inserts "+" and selects the sense "addition"; Wikidata shows the syntax of addition: two addends; the user writes "b" and selects variable and it does the same with "c".
I hope I was clear.--Lore.mazza51 (talk) 04:23, 14 September 2019 (UTC)

To annotate formulae with their semantics in Wikipedia articles, consider using the AnnoMathTeX system:
http://annomathtex.wmflabs.org/. The semantically annotated formulae will be stored the system's database and subsequently seeded into Wikidata. See also: [13].--PhilMINT (talk) 10:10, 14 September 2019 (UTC)
@PhilMINT: Thank you for the suggestion, but annomathtex seems to work only with Wikipedia articles, not Wikidata.--Lore.mazza51 (talk) 06:29, 19 September 2019 (UTC)
@Lore.mazza51: Yes, it can be used to employ Wikipedia articles to get semantically annotated formulae for Wikidata. In the future, it will be possible to assign Wikidata QIDs to formula entities.--PhilMINT (talk) 11:42, 20 September 2019 (UTC)
@Lore.mazza51: I'm trying to get the Tex-datatype in Wikidata fixed (see Contact_the_development_team). Once done, annotations like on Q862169 with defining formula (P2534), in defining formula (P7235) and calculated from (P4934) should be easier to query. --- Jura 09:52, 20 September 2019 (UTC)
