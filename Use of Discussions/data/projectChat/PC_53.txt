Use_heritage_designation_(P1435)_for_UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites_instead_of_instance_of_(P31)_?
Currently, all World Heritage Sites in Wikidata are indicated using instance of (P31) UNESCO World Heritage Site (Q9259). I'm sure we should use heritage designation (P1435) for this instead. Any objections to me changing all of them? e.g. Beni Hammad Fort (Q500367) heritage designation (P1435) UNESCO World Heritage Site (Q9259) instead of Beni Hammad Fort (Q500367) instance of (P31) UNESCO World Heritage Site (Q9259) NavinoEvans (talk) 22:10, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

Why do not we use both? I thought it is best practice to have P31 in every item.--Ymblanter (talk) 06:49, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
Indeed we should have P31 for every item, but perhaps something more precise than UNESCO World Heritage Site (Q9259). /ℇsquilo 09:46, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes this is bad use of the P31 property. Some World Heritage Sites are buildings and others are parks. Heritage status should be used instead of P31. --Jane023 (talk) 16:56, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
Many thanks for the feedback. I should clarify that all examples I've seen so far already have another instance of (P31) statement to indicate what the item is (as it should be), we'd simply be removing the extra instance of (P31) statement and using heritage designation (P1435) instead.

@Jane023, NavinoEvans: I'll repeat my usual bla bla but  we can totally conceptually have classes for say World heritage parks, for example. author  TomT0m / talk page 08:27, 12 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes that is an even better idea. Much cleaner. --Jane023 (talk) 17:13, 12 September 2015 (UTC)
@Jane023, TomT0m: I can see that it works conceptually, but it seems like a very bad idea in this case. For a start there are lots of different cultural heritage lists (e.g. registered historic monument (Q10387575), class A Swiss cultural property of national significance (Q8274529)), national historic site of Canada (Q1568567)), so to be consistent, wouldn't we need to create an item for every combination of type of site with notable heritage list! ? For example, "national historic site of Canada park", "UNESCO World Heritage park etc etc... It's so much simpler to just use heritage designation (P1435) to show it's a World Heritage Site and let P31 describe what type of thing it is as it already does (park, castle, lake etc.) NavinoEvans (talk) 19:42, 12 September 2015 (UTC)

@NavinoEvans: No we would not. That's actually one of the main advantage of classes : we can define them the way we want, which gives a lot of freedom compared to the strict heritage list the monument is listed in. This could allow, for example, to regroup buildings of listed on analog lists of several country (just saying) in the same classified building class. Also note that the two are not mutually exclusive, of course. author  TomT0m / talk page 20:32, 12 September 2015 (UTC)
@TomT0m: I fully understand the point about not being mutually exclusive, absolutely true :) But I still don't get why it's necessary make new classes. Surely we can run any query we like by using whatever combination of P31 and heritage designation (P1435) that is needed? I also don't understand why your suggestion would not involve creating lots of new items so they could be used in classification statements (like the "World Heritage parks" example that you've given). Can you please explain further? NavinoEvans (talk) 08:56, 13 September 2015 (UTC)
@NavinoEvans: The creation (or not) of new items is not really a point here. There is two ways to create a query : Using the live query point, but this needs to be written in SPARQL, so it's not doable for anyone, or follow the initial Wikidata plan, that will probably be fulfilled in the future : creating "query entities", like ther is property entites and items. Then the question of which query to create is the same as the question of whether or not create class items. (Also note that if we can use query entities in statements we might also be able to use them in instance of (P31) one, which would open some interisting workflow doors). So I don't think that, even if they are great, queries will solve magically this kind of problems :) The underlying question of whether or not create equivalents of the old so called "intersected categories" will not totally vanish. But what I fight against, in this context, is that we will have to create every possible combinations ... all the interesting part, and the exercise is called "classification", is to choose the one to create. author  TomT0m / talk page 13:26, 13 September 2015 (UTC)
@TomT0m: Apologies for the delayed response. Thanks for the extra information, some very interesting points about the future query namespace :) I can see the merit of using classes here, but are you saying that we should only use classes to describe this? or use classes in addition to heritage designation (P1435)? If there's no objections to using heritage designation (P1435) then I can add all of those statement but leave the P31 statements as they are for now - If there's any further discussion needed about the correct use of P31 in this case then I think it would be a good idea to move it over to the classification noticeboard? NavinoEvans (talk) 15:41, 15 September 2015 (UTC)
One advantage of not using instance of (P31) UNESCO World Heritage Site (Q9259) is that then items will get a "missing P31" constraint violation, if they do not say what sort of site they are -- a useful check.  Jheald (talk) 09:31, 13 September 2015 (UTC)
