official_name_(P1448)_//_native_label_(P1705)
Hello
I'd like to pinpoint a problem with official name (P1448) : its description, whatever wikidata language, has it that item should have only official local language. So I've been good faith reverted here https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q710&oldid=1245835824 . I've restated my statement in French because I think official name (P1448) should be broader and welcome any "official" statement about its name. See https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183#P1448 . Am I correct suggesting a broader definition of official name (P1448) (official name used in any language by any government office) and keep local official name to the native label (P1705) ?

I agree, there is a major problem with assuming that there is a single official language in which a official name/native name can be stated. Often its as easy as that but in a case like Switzerland (Q39) there are 4 official languages (see here) and the single "most official" name of the country is in Latin and used if only one language can be used (eg on coins). On the other hand, you often want to have a single truthy statement when asking "what is the official name of Germany in its native language" and the answer should be "Deutschland", so this solution also strikes me as bad. So I am not sure your proposal is great for that purpose, we could use qualifiers (or ranks, but this sounds like a bad idea) to indicate which is the official native language and which are official names of the item in other languages. You could always use  official language (P37) to figure out which uses of official name (P1448) are in native language and which ones are not, but I would be in favour of a rule that if official name (P1448)  has more than one entry, then a qualifier (yet to be determined) *must* to be used. --Hannes Röst (talk) 15:04, 3 August 2020 (UTC)
