Nothing_to_do_with_the_above
Ping Ymblanter, but I think Sude Nisa Bodur (Q107036039) should be deleted even before empty cats, because the item is only invented to make a link to an unnotable person. Thx. --E4024 (talk) 19:41, 4 June 2021 (UTC)

You've already nominated this item for deletion. Bringing your complaint here is just canvassing. There are hundreds of requests for deletion. We sensibly keep them on their own page, rather than this one. Please respect that convention. --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:56, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
Please don't exaggerate. Why would I canvass? Who is she? What importance does she (or the item) have? I was just trying to attract attention to the same issue you said: "There are hundreds of requests for deletion." The reason of that backlog is the fact that such obvious cases are still there, only because a bot says "there is a link". And the winner issss... The link is added by an LTA to keep "his" own item a few days more... It is not even about this very item but about the LTA whose images are being deleted from Commons everyday and whose item is still here. (BTW I did not even comment in that person's own item for deletion, as it is / as the two are so clear cases. Neither he nor his sister are of no interest to me nor to Wikidata.) Best. --E4024 (talk) 20:07, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
"Why would I canvass?", you say, as you canvass some more: "I was just trying to attract attention". smh --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:22, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
