two_data_tables
Hi
I have two data tables which need linking
Only one column (text) is common to both tables, however is not an exact match. There is just one or two words that make a link.
I need an easier method where I can link the two tables on a monthly basis
Table 1 has product specific data from suppliers, with cost of each product 
Table 2 has product specific data from customers, with sale price of each product and QTY sold
If you can help in any way, ie a software or website that converts the data
Help is much appreciated,  – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Akhan1984 (talk • contribs) at 9. 8. 2018, 00:37‎ (UTC).
