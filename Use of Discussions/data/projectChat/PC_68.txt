Heavy_problem_in_Q9068_(Voltaire)
Some 250 or even more years ago, some nasty and medieval cleric made a smear campaign by naming Voltaire a "demon" - one of the greatest philosophers of all time. Today, Wikidata features and - much worse - conservates forever this barbaric smear action and stupidity in Voltaire's wikidata item [text: incarnation of: demon"], shamefully masking it with the (hardly findable) attribute "refuted for superstition" or similar. I made a long statement there on the talk page, but was not heard yet. I am a bit tired to discuss about something which I find hard to discuss about at all in the first place, so this will be my last edit concerning this matter. May the enlightenment prevail ;-) Pittigrilli (talk) 18:53, 29 January 2021 (UTC)

Wondering where you stand on the Schleswig-Holstein Question. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:17, 30 January 2021 (UTC)
I think one forgot to link Help:Ranking#Deprecated_rank on Talk:Q9068 --- Jura 15:30, 30 January 2021 (UTC)
I am sorry guys, but sometimes one can be blind. That is you. What is the purpose/the use case/the benefit of writing a piece of (ahem) information which was even refuted at the time that it was made by thinking people in a today's database on facts? If your answer is sth like "historically interesting", then I answer: Maybe. But then it should in the Wikipedia articles, and not in Wikidata. The fact stands there broad and bold, and then there is a little addition "Oh yeah, by the way, this is wrong." The Wikidata is the wrong place for a discussion of superstition and prejudices of medieval quality in about 150 characters. That is at least confusing to most people seeing this. But do as you like. btw, I am sure Martin Luther was also called the devil or demon by some catholic cleric - why don't go search and put in Wikidata? Have fun.

You miss the point. Wikidata is not the place to arbitrate the accusation that was made, but to record the fact of it being made. As Jura points out, the claim is deprecated, which is appropriate handling for an incorrect claim which nevertheless was made. --Tagishsimon (talk) 16:24, 30 January 2021 (UTC)
Wikidata isn't just a database of facts. It's also a database of claims made by various sources. The particular book that's the source Dictionnaire Infernal is notable enough to have a Wikipedia article in 16 different languages. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:25, 30 January 2021 (UTC)
If you think it should be in Wikipedia, I don't see why it shouldn't be here. Usually, the question is different: should Wikipedia include some (possibly fringe) view in their neutral point of view of today. And then endless Wikipedia discussions follow. Wikidata just notes it and then moves on. --- Jura 12:22, 31 January 2021 (UTC)
Ok, as all of you are wrong (joke) - no, ok, I see the point. I agree to disagree and accept the majority view. Thanks for the discussion, Pittigrilli (talk) 17:08, 31 January 2021 (UTC)
