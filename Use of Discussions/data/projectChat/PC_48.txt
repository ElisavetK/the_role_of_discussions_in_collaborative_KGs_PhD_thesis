Problem_with_Egyptian_Arabic_Wikipedia
User @HitomiAkane: from Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia is not allowing users to create redirects from original names in its original alphabets. He has noticeable requests about that at his talk page which he refuses. He refers to local policy page at arz:ويكيبيديا:طريقة الكتابه but this kind of redirects are present in other versions of Wikipedia and I will link for example redirect to en:Egyptian Arabic from en:اللغة المصرية العامية. He says that "creating redirects in another language means the we should create over one million redirects, and it'll be all useless" which is probably false because Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia has now over 1,180,000 articles and I don't guess they all are all releated to items which names are written in other alphabet than Egyptian Arabic in other words all these articles aren't for example about British cities so they would require redirects from original name in latin alphabet. So with this unique expection from Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia it will collide with Wikidata items. Summarizing you can't add redirect to original name in its original alphabet at Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia but you can do it at any other version of Wikipedia. That's atleast odd for me.

Wikidata is not the place where the policies of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia get decided. Given that you don't read Arabic, what make you think that you know their redirect policy better then them? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:11, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
@ChristianKl: What make them think they know better than other over 300 Wikipedia projects? Why they can have exception? Eurohunter (talk) 16:14, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
Every Wikipedia project has it's own policies about what's notable on their project. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:19, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
Agree. Every Wikipedia has its own rules and I cannot see how this impacts Wikidata, so, it's also the wrong place to discuss. The right place would be the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia. --Christian140 (talk) 16:42, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
@ChristianKl: Thanks for your reasonable comments, as I explained so many times to user @Eurohunter: we only uses Egyptian alphabet in Masri Wikipedia as articles names and redirects, if we to create redirects in Latin alphabet we'll need to create hundreds of thousands of redirects ( ex: lake category contains over 80K articles ) and after all it's useless to the Egyptians users and against the local writing style policy, all I can see here is a conflict of interest towards one article which is @Eurohunter: interested in.

@HitomiAkane: So would you like to say that something is wrong with whole rest of the world who create hundrests of these redirects in diferent alphabets? Why is this possible? Please explain. Where is the logic? Eurohunter (talk) 17:56, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
It's worth noting here that the claim that all other Wikipedia's allow these kind of redirects is false as well. I remember the Chinese Wikipedia also not allowing them. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:09, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
what does any of this have to do with wikidata? BrokenSegue (talk) 18:06, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
