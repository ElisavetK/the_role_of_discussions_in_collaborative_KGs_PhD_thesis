United_Nations_membership_and_successor_states
United Nations membership is currently modelled using member of (P463): United Nations (Q1065), with start time (P580) (and sometimes end time (P582)) qualifiers. Generally this information seems fairly complete and accurate. There is, however, a slight oddity surrounding successor states, particularly of the former Soviet Union. At the signing of the Charter of the United Nations (Q171328), not only was Soviet Union (Q15180) a member, but also Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Q2895) and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Q133356) in their own right. 
At the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia (Q159) took that seat, and the other two were replaced in turn by Belarus (Q184) and Ukraine (Q212). Each of the former three have a relevant 1991 end time (P582) qualifier on their member of (P463): United Nations (Q1065) statement, but each of the latter three have a start time (P580) dating the whole way back to 1945 (in Ukraine's case with a slightly odd subject has role (P2868): Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Q133356) qualifier). I can understand why each would want to claim that their UN membership started in 1946 rather than 1991, but it seems odd to me for both Q2895 and Q184 (say) to claim to have been members at the same time. 
I suspect we probably want to update each member of (P463) for the modern states to their 1990s date, and add relevant replaces (P1365)/replaced by (P1366) qualifiers, but as this seems like it might potentially be contentious, I figure it's worth asking about it here first. Thoughts? Alternatives? --Oravrattas (talk) 10:36, 20 May 2020 (UTC)

I'd say so, since Belarus (Q184) for example only represents the country since 1991, it doesn't make sense for it to have any start date preceding that. Following replaces (P1365) you get Belarus (Q184) -> Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Q2895) -> Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (Q68678) and Lithuanianâ€“Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Q76236) and after that you are in a loop.
