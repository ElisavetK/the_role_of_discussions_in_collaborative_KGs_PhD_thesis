African_World_Heritage_Day
Hi all
Today is African World Heritage Day and I have created a small project to help improve knowledge of African World Heritage Sites on Wikipedia in all languages. I'm using Wikidata as the central index for the project using Listeria, its a really amazing tool. Please get involved and also share the link (especially in languages other than English) to encourage more people to take part, there is a social media sharing section at the bottom of the page.
Many thanks
