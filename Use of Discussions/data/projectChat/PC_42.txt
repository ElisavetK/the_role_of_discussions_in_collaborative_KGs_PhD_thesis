Multi-lingual_project_chat_links_broken
The links in the panel at the top of this page, to project chat in other languages, are not clickable. Can someone fix this, please? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 15:47, 12 May 2018 (UTC)

Â Done There is an issue with the use of <bdi> in link text that causes said bdi tag to be rendered outside the link (the link is still there on the page, but there is no text inside said <a> element).
