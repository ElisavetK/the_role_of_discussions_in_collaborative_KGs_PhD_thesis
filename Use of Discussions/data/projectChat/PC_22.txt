Preview_gadget
1) The preview gadget is broken since jquery got upgraded to version 1.9.  (.after is no longer supported, the way it was used in the gadget).  I propose a fix for this MediaWiki talk:Gadget-Preview.js#Proposed fix for broken gadget.
2) I have been using a modified version of the gadget for a while, that by default shows a default preview (guessed, based on my user language, shows preview from the associated wikipedia).  Would folks like that as part of the official gadget? MediaWiki_talk:Gadget-Preview.js#Default_display
