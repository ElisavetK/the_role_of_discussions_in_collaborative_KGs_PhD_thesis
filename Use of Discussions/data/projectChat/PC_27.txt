Thank you. Naddruf (talk) 01:24, 23 July 2020 (UTC)

@Naddruf: they are not the same. one is about the series and one is about the game. BrokenSegue (talk) 02:22, 23 July 2020 (UTC)
@BrokenSegue: If they are different, then maybe they should have different names. I was trying to understand the difference between en:Mario Kart Arcade GP and simple:Mario Kart Arcade GP, and it was confusing. Naddruf (talk) 02:46, 23 July 2020 (UTC)
@Naddruf: Lots of things have the same name but different meanings here. You should look at the descriptions/types to figure out what the item represents. BrokenSegue (talk) 03:10, 23 July 2020 (UTC)
I guess then it's the Wikipedia articles that need qualifiers, so we know what the differences are. Naddruf (talk) 05:10, 23 July 2020 (UTC)
