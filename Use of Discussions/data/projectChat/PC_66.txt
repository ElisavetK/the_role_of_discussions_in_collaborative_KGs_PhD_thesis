Does_country_house_need_merging?
There seems to be country house (Q16884952) and English country house (Q1343246) both of which point at English country house. Should the Wikidata items be merged? And should the result be called "country house" or "English country house". If the latter, what about similar types of buildings in other countries? Pauljmackay (talk) 16:36, 5 March 2017 (UTC)
Well, one of them is a redirect. I thought redirects shouldn't have their item? MechQuester (talk) 16:38, 5 March 2017 (UTC)

It doesn't need merging as it's possible to have country houses outside of the UK. On the other hand English country house (Q1343246) is clearly a subclass of country house (Q16884952). ChristianKl (talk) 18:42, 5 March 2017 (UTC)
It's interesting that the German "Land haus" is in with mansion (Q1802963). I am not convinced of the need for a separate "country house" item between English country house (Q1343246) and mansion (Q1802963), if the only sitelink is to a redirect. Jheald (talk) 08:34, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
The German word is "Landhaus" and not "Land haus" but that's besides the point. The term doesn't say anything about a house being located in Germany or having anything to do with Germany. The term can easily applied to many houses outside of Germany. Most entities that qualify are likely outside of Germany. On the other hand the term "English country house" is quite specific and refers to houses inside of England. Given that it does equal "country house" I have moved the Wikilink to that item.

So you've just broken all the interwiki links that "Landhaus" previously had. Is that really an improvement? It's part of what Wikidata is, that there's a bit of elasticity in the concepts that our items match to. The question was not whether "Landhaus" was a good match for "English country house" -- there's already an article "English country house" on dewiki. The question is whether "Landhaus" (and country house, generally) is a good enough match for mansion (Q1802963), to be worth keeping the interwiki links together. That, to me, is a much more evenly balanced question. Jheald (talk) 09:59, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
You can have a mansion that's in a city. Being in a city doesn't conflict with the concept of what a mansion happens to be. It does conflict with the concept of a "country house" or a "Landhaus". En.Wiki says "Fifth Avenue in New York City, was lined with mansions". That shows to me that a different thing than "Landhaus" is meant.
Given that people can specify the identity of a building via P31 it's useful to have the labels of different languages mean the same thing even when that means that there are less interwiki links. ChristianKl (talk) 11:14, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
A country house doesn't cease to be such just because someone moves an administrative line on a map. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:50, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
The linked controlled vocabulary says: "Note: Houses in the country as opposed to an urban area, especially houses that are large, have substantial property, and are used seasonally." It's not simply the architecture of the house but whether it's in the country or the city matters. ChristianKl (talk) 14:55, 7 March 2017 (UTC)
You appear to be confusing (or at least making free with the ambiguity between) the meanings of different phrases. A building that is in a city may still be in the country. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 00:03, 14 March 2017 (UTC)
