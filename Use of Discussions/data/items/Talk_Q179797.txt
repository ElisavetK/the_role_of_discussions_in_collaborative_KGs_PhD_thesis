A problem with this item is that the English Wikipedia has two distinct articles on thesauri, one for the reference works (synonym dictionaries) and [[:en:Thesaurus (information retrieval)|another]] for the controlled vocabularies meant for subject indexing (see {{Q|Q17152639}}). All other Wikipedias have one article for both meanings. Which English article should be linked to the other languages?

:Sure, also French Wikipedia have two pages: [[:fr:Thésaurus]] for the documentation tool and [[:fr:Thesaurus (dictionnaire)]] for the lexicographic tool. I can't make the change, but I'll thank in advance the whom that can make it !

::There was {{Q|17152639}} for for the documentation tool and {{Q|179797}} for the dictionary. You seem to have mixed or reversed the two by your edits, so I had to rollback most of it. There is also {{Q|9087300}} for disambiguation pages that link to both types of thesauri. -- [[User:JakobVoss|JakobVoss]] ([[User talk:JakobVoss|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:58, 28 June 2016 (UTC)
:::{{ping|JakobVoss}} I di not understand what [//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q3523914&action=history you did]. We need to have two different items for thesaurus: one for documentary thesaurus and the other for lexicographic thesaurus. Now we have only 3 elements: {{q|179797}}, {{q|Q17152639}} and {{q|9087300}} for the disambiguation page. [[User:Pamputt|Pamputt]] ([[User talk:Pamputt|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:57, 28 June 2016 (UTC) What element for what concept?

::::{{ping|Pamputt}} I first tried to fix by hand and then found it too confusing, so I did reverts. For documentary thesaurus keep using {{SQID|Q=17152639}}. For lexicographic thesaurus keep using {{SQID|Q=179797}}. If there is a disambiguation page "thesaurus", link it to {{q|9087300}} -- [[User:JakobVoss|JakobVoss]] ([[User talk:JakobVoss|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:36, 28 June 2016 (UTC)

:::::: {{Ping|JakobVoss}} Is not a documentary thesaurus just a subclass of thesaurus ? It seems a documentation thesaurus meets the definition of lexicographic thesaurus. <span style="border: 1px #C9C9C9;"><span style="background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:3px;">author&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">&nbsp;[[User:TomT0m|TomT0m]] / </span>talk [[User talk:TomT0m|page]]</span> 20:19, 28 June 2016 (UTC)
