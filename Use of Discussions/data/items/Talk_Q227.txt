== {{P|P30}} ==

I can't find where {{P|P30}} was added in the version history. Can you help please? --[[User:Jobu0101|Jobu0101]] ([[User talk:Jobu0101|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:27, 19 June 2018 (UTC)
:{{ping|Jobu0101}} [[Special:Diff/5815312|Here.]] I don't know offhand if the inference you mentioned on Wikidata:Project chat is automatically made; hence why I said 'ideally'. If it ''isn't'' made, then this certainly deserves greater attention.

::{{ping|Mahir256}} Thanks. I was using Ctrl+F in the version history overview and looked for "P30" and "continent". I guess back then those string didn't show up in the summary. How did you find it? --[[User:Jobu0101|Jobu0101]] ([[User talk:Jobu0101|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:18, 19 June 2018 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Jobu0101}} I just [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q227&offset=&limit=500&action=history displayed 500 revisions at a time], looked at the last revision on each page of 500 revisions until reaching a page where the last revision lacks the statement, then looked at the latest revision from each contributor up from the earliest contributor on that page until the statement appeared during a person's contributions, then looked downward among that person's contributions to find the diff. (It's sort of like binary search; I don't know of any better way myself to do this. I also don't know if you wanted this much detail about how I found it.)
