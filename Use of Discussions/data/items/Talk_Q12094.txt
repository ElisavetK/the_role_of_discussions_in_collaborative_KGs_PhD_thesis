==Official name==

{{ping|Jura1}} Official name of a Swiss canton always includes the designating type information ("canton of ..."). It is indeed often used without it where the context is given, but it is just an abbreviation. As [[Property:P1448|official name]] defines – "''official name of the subject in its official language(s)''" – the official name of AI is indeed "Kanton Appenzell Ausserrhoden", or in English, canton of Appenzell Outer-Rhodes, or canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, if you like.

:Sure, please just don't confuse {{P|1448}} and the value to add there with what goes in the label field. For the label, please follow [[Help:Label]]. If you add a P1448, it would be helpful if you included a reference as well. Obviously, any official name can be a valid alias. <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 15:54, 21 August 2018 (UTC)
::Sure. But if the definition speaks about the ''official'' name, why is then an abbreviation taken? And shouldn't there be a consistency among all items of the same kind? Or in other words: why are the most Swiss cantons labelled as "canton of ... " then? -- [[User:ZH8000|ZH8000]] ([[User talk:ZH8000|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:04, 21 August 2018 (UTC)
:::Where do you read that on [[Help:Label]]? In English it says "common name that the item would be known by". Besides, where do you get take it from that it's an abbreviation?  <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 16:16, 21 August 2018 (UTC)
::::I see, Label <> official name. I did never like and understand the common name attribution with respect to official items. – Well, I should rather speak about a long, official version and a short version, instead of abbreviation (AI). All Swiss cantons always use the long version in their labels, see e.g. [https://www.ai.ch/ Kanton Appenzell Innerrhoden]. The short version is usually used in a given context when it is obvious that one speaks about the canton (which can be often, of course). You can call it the common version. -- [[User:ZH8000|ZH8000]] ([[User talk:ZH8000|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:41, 21 August 2018 (UTC)
:::::It seems it hadn't been in ages, except that you changed it recently. I restored the English and French version. If you need a reference for the French names, please check the identifiers at the bottom of the item. <br/>--- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 04:06, 22 August 2018 (UTC)
