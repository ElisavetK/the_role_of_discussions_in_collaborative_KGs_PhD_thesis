== not Suleyman Shah, but Gunduz Alp ==

It is proved, that  Ertogrul's father was Gunduz Alp, not Suleyman Shah.

See : [http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/pdf/c11/c110193.pdf Nitekim ele geçen Osman Bey'e ait bir sikkede "Osman b. Ertuğrul b. Gündüz Alp" ibaresinin bulunması bu fikri daha da güçlendirmiştir.]

:"Gündüz Alp". Pre-Islamic Turkish names. According to the historian Necdet Sakaoğlu, even Osman I could be "Tuman". Probably Ottoman historians "adapted" some names to new times. I have no idea, only what I read in books. (I mean it is -probably- a "naming" issue; although identities of people may also have been confused. Who knows?) --[[User:E4024|E4024]] ([[User talk:E4024|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:54, 8 August 2019 (UTC)

== Sultans of the Ottoman Empire ==

If a person was born and died even before the Ottoman State was founded, let alone its becoming an "empire", that person cannot be categorized as "Sultan of the Ottoman Empire". (The place where this person lies was conquered by the Ottomans several centuries after his passing away, BTW.) --[[User:E4024|E4024]] ([[User talk:E4024|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:57, 8 August 2019 (UTC)
