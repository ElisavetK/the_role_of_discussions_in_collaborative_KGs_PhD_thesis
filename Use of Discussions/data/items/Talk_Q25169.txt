Hello,

It seems there is a mess in the Wikipedia links : This item is about the series of five novels, but what I can see (with the help of the categories and Google Translate for the languages I don't speak) is :

* de, hr, hu, ko, sk → OK, they are about the series of novels.
* bg, en, he, es, id, it, nl, pt, ru, sv → media franchise (radio series + theatre plays + novels + movies...)
* fr → fictional universe
* cs, sl, sq, uk, zh → {{Q|3107329}} (the first novel only.)

To make things more complicated, uk: and zh: are already listed in  {{Q|3107329}} but it looks like the articles there are about the media franchise...

If you are a speaker of the languages above, can you please confirm my interpretation of the contents of the articles is right before I move everything around? -[[User:Ash Crow|Ash Crow]] ([[User talk:Ash Crow|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:01, 27 August 2014 (UTC)

:{{ping|Ash Crow}}, actually Ukrainian article is about the series of novels but briefly mentions media franchise. However, I had to swap uk: between {{Q|25169}} and {{Q|3107329}}, so now it is correct: series here and first novel at {{Q|3107329}} — [[User:NickK|NickK]] ([[User talk:NickK|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 05:06, 11 January 2015 (UTC)
