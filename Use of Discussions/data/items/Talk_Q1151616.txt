Has there been a discussion on the English description of this? At present, the description conflicts with the statement's label. My suggestion would be: 'a group of people who describe their geographical area as a country, but is not recognised by the UN as a state.' Percentage of local inhabitants is irrelevant here. Even if a country, a people or nation has 51% in favour of independence, and not recognised but other nations or the UN, it would still be a stateless nation. Or am I missing something?
