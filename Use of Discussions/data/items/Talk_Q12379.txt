I have removed a duplicate statement (is that even the proper term?) with the "character has role" thing, as its already stated what roles he had in "present in work" i'm not sure if there is some need for it so excuse me if this is in error, or if I have done anything else wrong here, I am very new to this wiki.

: Hi [[User:TheAwesomeHwyh|TheAwesomeHwyh]], thanks for pointing out this issue: Currently information about {{Q|Q1062345}}/{{Q|Q466466}}/etc. is scattered across three places: as a statement with {{P|P2868}}, as a qualifier to {{P|P1441}} and at the work item as a qualifier to {{P|P674}} (see {{Q|Q854479}} as an example). This should be standardised. I'm going to take this question to [[Wikidata:WikiProject_Video_games]] to get more opinions about where to put this information. {{P|P5800}} should be rather used as a statement, not as a qualifier, as those statements may be controversial or in need of qualifiers themselves. - [[User:Valentina.Anitnelav|Valentina.Anitnelav]] ([[User talk:Valentina.Anitnelav|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:21, 1 February 2019 (UTC)
:: I just saw at [[Wikidata:WikiProject_Video_games#Properties]] that it is recommended to indicate the playability of characters at the work as a qualifier to {{P|P674}}. In this case it is probably not even necessary to give this information also at the character item. I opened a topic at [[Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Video_games#Place_for_information_about_the_playability_of_characters]] concerning this issue. - [[User:Valentina.Anitnelav|Valentina.Anitnelav]] ([[User talk:Valentina.Anitnelav|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:46, 1 February 2019 (UTC)
