:: {{ping|Harmonia Amanda}} I wonder how the German Wikipedia knows that she is "deutsche" - beyond than just working in Germany. There is a lot of researchers working in a country where they are not citizens. &mdash; [[User:Fnielsen|Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen)]] ([[User talk:Fnielsen|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:51, 24 October 2018 (UTC)
:::That, I have no idea. You would have to ask the Wikimedian who added the information there. --[[User:Harmonia Amanda|Harmonia Amanda]] ([[User talk:Harmonia Amanda|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:52, 24 October 2018 (UTC)
:::: But does "eine deutsche Informatikerin" allows us to infer that she has German citizenship and put that information into Wikidata? For researchers, I would be reluctant. &mdash; [[User:Fnielsen|Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen)]] ([[User talk:Fnielsen|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:03, 24 October 2018 (UTC)
::::: I have removed it now. No source, - beyond Wikipedia. &mdash; [[User:Fnielsen|Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen)]] ([[User talk:Fnielsen|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:33, 29 October 2018 (UTC)
