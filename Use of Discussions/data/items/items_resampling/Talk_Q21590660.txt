Is this the same as [[Q172980]]?
:{{ping|Andycyca}} No: one describes a film genre (Q172980) and one the broader genre that includes the film genre, alongside other mediums. [[User:Sadads|Sadads]] ([[User talk:Sadads|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:27, 2 November 2016 (UTC)
::{{ping|Sadads}} Thanks! Then there's a lot of work to do on the individual wikipedia articles, because this isn't made clear in some of them --[[User:Andycyca|Andycyca]] ([[User talk:Andycyca|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:18, 2 November 2016 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Andycyca}} Yeah, I keep running into cross-language scope problems when working on literary genres: back in the day when they were "just interwiki links", people were a bit more lax about the connections between concepts. Now with Wikidata, there is a lot less room for ambiguity, and we need to make sure that multitopical pages, get interwikied properly on Wikidata and concepts get split :P [[User:Sadads|Sadads]] ([[User talk:Sadads|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 02:52, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
::::{{ping|Sadads}} Any chance of making even a small evento for it? Something like Asia Month --[[User:Andycyca|Andycyca]] ([[User talk:Andycyca|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 03:44, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::{{Ping|Andycyca}} Oh gosh! I am worn out running http://1lib1ref.org and I might try doing another campaign for my WMF/GLAM job at some other point, I don't want to run another in volunteer time :P You would be great for that!

::::::{{ping|Sadads}} Hm, yes, I hadn't think of that, maybe I should run a contest like that. I'll get to the blackboard. Any pointers are most welcome! --[[User:Andycyca|Andycyca]] ([[User talk:Andycyca|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:10, 3 November 2016 (UTC)
:::::::{{ping|Andycyca}} Happy to consult! I think their needs to be some kind of gamefication or contestization, where a list of actions can easily be turned into something fun, useful models include: [[Wikidata:Europeana Art History Challenge]] or the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Africa/The_Africa_Destubathon|Africa Destubathon]].
