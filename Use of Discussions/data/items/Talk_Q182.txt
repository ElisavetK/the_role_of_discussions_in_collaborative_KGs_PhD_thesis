*: Not language. [[Q1342520]] is for a word Anglais. Otherwise is {{Q|2849608}} about language? --[[User:Infovarius|Infovarius]] ([[User talk:Infovarius|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:23, 5 February 2020 (UTC)
::: I'm not sure what you mean? In English the word "English" can be used for the language or as an adjective for the nationality as in "English ladies" or "English muffins", hence the need for a disambiguation page for the word. Anglais does not mean anything in English or German. In German the language is called "englisch", i usually see it with a small "e" and i don't fully understand the grammar of why.

:::"is {{Q|2849608}} about language?" No, that seems to be about an entertainment venue in Sweden. [[User:Irtapil|Irtapil]] ([[User talk:Irtapil|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:15, 16 February 2020 (UTC)

The Urdu doesn't look right either, خوف appears to be the word "fear" https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%81#Urdu - the Urdu wiki article on the English language is called انگریزی زبان roughly "Ingrizee zaban" or "Angreezi zaban" Zaban is language and انگریزی resembles the listed Persian انگلیسی Ingraisee / Angraisy (roughly) and Sindhi انگریزي Ingreizi / Angreezy (roughly) so seems plausible, but i don't feel fully justified in adding it because I speak speak hardly any Urdu. I moved خوف to alt terms on the off chance it's slang, and i left the main term blank.
