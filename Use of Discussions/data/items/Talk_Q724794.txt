== The date of marriage ==

Date of marriage could be circled in. In ''The Islander'' Thom√°s says that they married on the '''last week of Shrovetide in 1878'''. I'm not shure which period Shrovetide describes but I think it is the 40-days period before eastern. Maybe someone knows more about these catholic rites an can clearify that.
