What is ''universe (Q36906466)''? --[[User:Fractaler|Fractaler]] ([[User talk:Fractaler|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:41, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
:{{Ping|Fractaler}} Q36906466 is a class. Multiverses ([[Q3327819]]) contain universes ([[Q36906466]]) such as the Universe ([[Q1]]). See the second sense of [[wikt:universe#English]]. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 00:42, 18 August 2017 (UTC)
::[[wikt:en:universe#Noun|wikt said]]: ''universe (2) - entity similar to our universe; one component of a larger entity known as the multiverse''. So, the set Q36906466 is a subset of {{Q|Q15989253}}? --[[User:Fractaler|Fractaler]] ([[User talk:Fractaler|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:32, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

{{Q|Q1454986}}? Description said: {{Q|Q36906466}} - "class of which Our Universe is an instance, and parallel universes, if any, are also instances". But {{Q|Q2051667}} is not {{Q|Q1454986}}, it is {{Q|Q18706315}}. --[[User:Fractaler|Fractaler]] ([[User talk:Fractaler|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:35, 20 August 2017 (UTC)
:{{Ping|Fractaler}} This is a very good point, and a general issue with hypothetical entities. For {{Q|Q2051667}}, if any exist, they are {{Q|Q1454986}}, but because they're hypothetical, their existence and status is in doubt, so they can't be stated/implied to be {{P|279}} {{Q|Q1454986}}. I'm not sure what the solution to this should be. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 02:30, 21 August 2017 (UTC)
::Each {{Q|Q488383}} exists in its own space/universe/world/space of existence of the object/etc ({{Q|Q29956845}}). What space (criterion - the destruction of space leads to the disappearance of its objects) we have for: 1) {{Q|Q2051667}}, 2){{Q|Q1454986}}? --[[User:Fractaler|Fractaler]] ([[User talk:Fractaler|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:26, 21 August 2017 (UTC)
::{{Ping|Fractaler}} {{Ping|Yair rand}} If we go down this path, then no hypothetical concept can have or be an instance, subclass, superclass, etc., of any other item (except an item that is explicitly hypothetical itself).  This would lead to a separate class hierarchy for hypothetical objects whose relationship to real objects is unclear, and large changes would have to be made as soon as someone decides that the hypothesis is true.  In the case of a class, I believe a hypothetical class may just mean that it may or may not have any concrete instances that exist in our physical world.  Its relationships with other classes may still be true regardless of whether it turns out to have any physical instances or not.  For example class1 subclass-of class2 means that if an item is an instance of class 1 then it must also be an instance of class2.  This may be true even if it turns out that no concrete instances of class1 are found to exist in the real world.
