Hi {{ping|Escudero}} currently this item is about a film version of the main character of the book {{Q|2899700}} in just one film adaptation. But it seems we don't have an item for the character in general (as it appears in books and another film adaptation as well). Do we need to create another item for that (and link both of them), or would it be okay to change this item into one about the character in general?

:Hi {{ping|Kam Solusar}} I think it's ok to use the same item for both the book character and the film character. [[User:Escudero|Escudero]] ([[User talk:Escudero|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 06:45, 5 July 2019 (UTC)
