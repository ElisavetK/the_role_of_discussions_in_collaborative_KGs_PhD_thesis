Due to administrative reform in Estonia karksi parish , Mõisaküla town Abja and hHalliste parishes were joined into a new administrative entity, Mulgi parish. So how to fix that thing, it was easy to change the reference box, but when I tried to substitute Karksi with Mulgi in location part nothing happens, it does not have option of saving the  correct data? - [[User:Melilac|Melilac]] ([[User talk:Melilac|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 04:57, 4 November 2017 (UTC)
