== German Klub ==

I moved the German ''Klub'' here as it means the same as ''Club'' in other languages. The article even gives it as an alternative spelling. The move was reverted by [[User:YMS]], saying: ''"Currently, the disambiguation page here are not separated cleanly, but as the two items cannot be merged anyway let's keep the "Klub" ones at Klub"''.<br/>
YMS, are you arguing only based on spelling or do you dispute that the German ''Klub'' has the same meaning as ''Club'' in other languages? --[[User:Oreg|Oreg]] ([[User talk:Oreg|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:51, 5 April 2018 (UTC)

: Disambiguation items are not about meaning at all. They are only about spelling. "Klub" is not the same as "Club", simply because "C" is not "K". The meanings of those words varies in the various languages anyway, so we can't go by meaning. And as I said: Even if we wanted to, we could not simply put all "Klub" pages to this item, as the Polish Wikipedia has two different disambiguation items for "Klub" and "Club". --[[User:YMS|YMS]] ([[User talk:YMS|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:55, 5 April 2018 (UTC)

::Thanks for your quick and helpful reply. I've read through [[Wikidata:WikiProject_Disambiguation_pages/guidelines|the guidelines]] and now understand better how this works. The C-K interchangeability appears to be a special case, though, on which there is [[Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Disambiguation_pages/guidelines|no consensus]]. One language's C is another's K. How is that commonly handled?
::In this particular case, that's the only difference between Klub and Club. The German and Czech WPs even make that explicit by redirecting one to the other. The German page even lists entries for both spellings.
::That leaves the Polish page for ''club''. It seems to me this page shouldn't even exist. It lists a defunct TV channel called ''Club TV''--not club--and a mathematical concept linked to [[pl:zbi√≥r stacjonarny]]---not club---and that, according to the English WP, is actually different from ''club sets''.
::What do you think? --[[User:Oreg|Oreg]] ([[User talk:Oreg|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:55, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
::{{ping|YMS}} I just now notice that there are three links here that differ in even more than one letter: [[no:Klubbe]], [[sv:Klubb]] and [[sw:Klabu]]. Then the C-K substitution should be doubly acceptable, no? --[[User:Oreg|Oreg]] ([[User talk:Oreg|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:51, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
::: As I said in my revert comment (you quoted it above), this disambiguation page is kind of a mess. To be correct, these three sitelinks should be removed from here as well. I would have done it, but I didn't want to make facts while we're still discussing here. --[[User:YMS|YMS]] ([[User talk:YMS|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:46, 20 April 2018 (UTC)

::::I appreciate your approach. A fundamental decision needs to be made whether or not to accept C-K substitution as two transliterations of the same thing. I guess here's not the place to have that discussion as it is not specific to this item. --[[User:Oreg|Oreg]] ([[User talk:Oreg|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 10:53, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
