== Is this an award ? ==
Is the class/rank of an order an award, or is the order itself the award?  I believe that the order is the organisation, whereas the rank (or membership) is the award.

However it is way too common to attribute the order as the {{P|P166}} (such as {{P|166}} = {{Q|Q163700}} !!); it is thus also necessary, at the moment, to keep {{Q|Q193622}} ''{{P|279}}'' {{Q|Q618779}}.

As a result, both {{Q|Q193622}} and {{Q|Q38033430}} must be subclasses of award, even if it is somewhat redundant.

* {{ping|Laddo}} Here's the problem: {{Q|618779}} {{P|279}} {{Q|4372150}} {{P|279}} {{Q|230788}} {{P|279}} {{Q|38033430}}. This change creates a loop, which logically implies that all four items are actually identical. Obviously they are not. How would you resolve this?

:: {{ping|ArthurPSmith}} Oh I see.  I'm afraid I misunderstood "class of award" - I thought it was like the rank of an order, rather than some superclass.  I reverted the change while I think a bit more about the issue.   '' [[User:Laddo|LaddΩ]]''  [[User_talk:Laddo|''<small>chat </small>'';)]] 02:56, 21 January 2019 (UTC)
