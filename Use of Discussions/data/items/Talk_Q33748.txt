== Why sports club? ==

{{Ping|Nortix08}} The wikipedia entries directly point to Hannover 96 as a football club, not other sports. Interested to know why this entity needs to be considered as a instance of {{Q|Q847017}} instead of {{Q|Q476028}}. Is there a separate entity for Hannover 96 football club? Maybe I missed --[[User:Unnited meta|Unnited meta]] ([[User talk:Unnited meta|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]])
: In the current state of the art of the Wikipedia articles there is written about the omni-sports club. In every language there is only one article about the whole club, no separate articles for parts of the club, what makes a big difference to FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen for instance, where a lot articles about other parts of the clubs also exist. So from my point of view, the categorization as sports club is correct.

:: But then the statements of {{P|P286}} , {{P| P634}} are not valid, you would have to add {{P|P641}} qualifiers everywhere. Shouldn't there be a separate entity that relates to matters of a single sport alone? Maybe {{Ping|Xaris333}} is aware of more discussions related to this --[[User:Unnited meta|Unnited meta]] ([[User talk:Unnited meta|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]])
::: A little bit more structure would be helpful, off course. But especially for items with a lot of fans it could be heavy to reach a consensus. I also already got a vandal warning for myself when trying to help...

: {{Ping|Unnited meta}} The German Wikipedia article refers to Hannover 96 as a sports club, although the major part in the article is the section on football. Maybe in the other languages only football is mentioned because the attention for badminton, billard or table tennis is not or only very little available.

:: Ok {{Ping|Nortix08}} , {{Ping|Florentyna}} understood. If we can implement something similar to the examples provided by Xaris333, that would be good? With a overall sports club entity and other individual sports clubs being part of it --[[User:Unnited meta|Unnited meta]] ([[User talk:Unnited meta|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:56, 20 July 2018 (UTC) 
::: I agree with {{Ping|Unnited meta}} but that would require lots of work to split and re-build the wikipedia articles for the sections of the club. [[User:Nortix08|Nortix08]] ([[User talk:Nortix08|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:25, 20 July 2018 (UTC)

If the item is about a sport club ({{Q|Q847017}}), we will only add statements that are about the sport club in general, not only about the football section. You can create items for each section to add the informations about each section (some statements may be the same). Example, {{Q|6165489}}, {{Q|714581}}, {{Q|12069029}}. But, I have noticed that Q33748 has link to English Wikipedia article [[:w:en:Hannover 96]] which is only about football. This link must move to the football section item. I can't say about the other interlinks. [[User:Xaris333|Xaris333]] ([[User talk:Xaris333|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:23, 19 July 2018 (UTC)
