*Sounds reasonable, {{Q|48469}} already uses that for Jupiter and Saturnus. -- [[User:Innocent bystander|Innocent bystander]] ([[User talk:Innocent bystander|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:49, 4 August 2016 (UTC)"

* {{Keep}} ""landing"" may refer to the return, not the destination of the mission - specifically this is how it has been used here for space shuttle flights. I don't think ""start point"" ""Kennedy Space Center"" ""destination point"" Vandenberg airforce base, is what you would expect for a description of a space shuttle flight. Leave {{P|1158}} as it is.

: {{keep}} I recommend keeping this one. The location of the landing of a spacecraft could differ from its destination point. For example, a Shuttle mission would have a location of landing of somewhere on Earth but could have a destination point of some point in space, the ISS or Earth depending on the mission and the definition.
