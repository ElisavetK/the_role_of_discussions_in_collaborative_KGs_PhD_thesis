**{{vk}} The rationale of a RFC that only 8 people participated in as a reason to delete is weak at best. --'''[[User:Rschen7754|Rs]][[User talk:Rschen7754|chen]][[Special:Contributions/Rschen7754|7754]]''' 10:55, 7 December 2013 (UTC)"

**{{Keep}} there are one-to-one correspondence between these images properties and elements in infoboxes of Wikipedias, as most of the properties. Ontologically join so different properties to one only because have the same datatype is without sense, for me. In this manner we could use only one properties for datatype and use qualifier to distinguish them! Another question: what about constraints? {{ping|Ivan A. Krestinin}} now it is possible to use constraint also with qualifiers? --[[User:Paperoastro|Paperoastro]] ([[User talk:Paperoastro|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 10:41, 8 December 2013 (UTC)"
