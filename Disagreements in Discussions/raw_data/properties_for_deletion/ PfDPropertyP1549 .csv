I would like to note that the property is used as label for {{p|27}} at huwiki. If the property is deleted, the current data needs to be imported into the newly accepted structure, and huwiki needs to be notified to create a workaround to the new structure if possible. Ideally, the new structure should make it possible. – [[User:Máté|Máté]] ([[User talk:Máté|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 12:10, 4 November 2018 (UTC)"

* {{comment}} If this property is being used in an infobox or by a Lua module, it will need to be retained and to go on having its values added to and extended, at least and until such time as inverse property values become obtainable via Lua - as at present they are not.

* {{hold}}. I agree with [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] that we need a place -> demonym property to keep infoboxes working.

* {{comment}}. As noted, 1) there is no wikibase client for lexemes, 2) there is no Lua function available for backlinks or API queries, pending of [[phab:T185313]] that it seems silently declined for a year now. There is not any path from a wiki page like [[:w:fr:Paris]] to reach {{L|26359}}. If these blockers are solved, there are still some concerns. How to deal with {{L|26359}} or {{L|25620}}? How to obtain the demonym for a given language and a lexical category? At the end, it will be one more, or several, arbitrary access and it is expensive in Lua time usage that has limitations in infoboxes powered by Wikidata. --[[User:Vriullop|Vriullop]] ([[User talk:Vriullop|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 07:52, 27 March 2019 (UTC)"

*{{Vote keep}} This is good for Wikidata but bad for infoboxes: Inverse properties is problematic, since is harder to code templates or modules to emulate the expected behaviour with inverse properties, and most of the nominators of those deletion request don't even address the problems that leads this deletions.
