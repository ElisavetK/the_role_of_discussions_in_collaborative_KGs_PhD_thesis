{{discussion top|1= It is clear that a large number of people don't like this, but that there is no consensus for deleting it. This mirrors the last discussion. While I could let this drag out for a while longer, I have little doubt that it would matter. For discussions this complex, PfD is not an effective venue for finding a solution. I will be starting a two part RfC myself shortly.

* Here's a new reason it should be deleted: It's use cannot be verified. Based on the discussion currently ongoing at [[WD:Project chat]], if we can't verify a claim, then we probably shouldn't make it. In that event then, P107 is tying us to an ontology which has not claimed to represent the million or so items which P107 is now on. I.e., it is not verifiable. On top of this, P107 can ''only'' be verified where there is already a GND ID. That fact makes it even useless for the cases where it can be verified, as the type can be gotten from querying the database if the type is even desirable for someone in those cases; its nonuse on en.wiki would indicate that that is not the case for our primary external users.<p>This is besides its other salient points for deletion, which are numerous and continuing to cause us problems in other ways. We should cease pretending like this is a good property. I was planning to start yet ''another'' RFC on it, but this seems opportune. /shrug --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 22:16, 17 June 2013 (UTC)"

*::::You seem to have a mistaken assumption Rschen. There's no reason to believe that this property would be deleted ''before'' it could be replaced by another property. The data is unlikely to go anywhere. As I said earlier, Zolo's proposal on the referenced page is a suitable candidate to replace most uses of this property. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 02:09, 22 June 2013 (UTC)"

* {{Vote delete}} – I looked at the archived discussion and saw many strong arguments for deletion, which in my opinion was not adequately answered by those who voted keep. P107 is by some supposed to give a high level classification system, but it doesn't work. I have worked a lot with the database dumps for Wikidata, and it is hard to use P107 for anything useful. Pr. 2013-06-10 there was 1221158 items with GND type person, but I cannot tell how many reel persons there is. If we dropped that useless GND type property and instead used the resources to {{P|31}} and {{P|279}} and other properties giving reel information, I could tell much more about the items.

*{{keep}} - I think that before we can even begin to discuss the deletion of this property we need a really good alternative in place.

:: {{Question}} – I do not quite understand. P107 can not be used to separate fictional people from real ones, so what is the connection between this property and the missing consensus about fictional people? [[User:Byrial|Byrial]] ([[User talk:Byrial|talk]]) 06:52, 18 June 2013 (UTC)"
"
::: General classification is necessary especially in query to be able to restrict the search in a medium extend. I agree with you about GND classification and its small number of possibilities but we need this kind of classification. The only good way to delete GND property is to propose first another classification: don't delete an bad system with nothing but with a proposition of a better system.

[[Property:P31|P31]] and [[Property:P279|P279]] are much better alternatives to P107: they're W3C recommendations for the Semantic Web that do what P107 does, but more robustly and without the major problems described in the linked discussion.
