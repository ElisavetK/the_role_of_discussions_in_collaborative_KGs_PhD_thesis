* {{ping|IagoQnsi}} Maybe the name should be modified, but I don't see the purpose of having multiple P1630's on a property. The Wikibase UI will only use one of them, and I'm not sure it currently correctly selects the preferred one (there's a delay in any case, so it's complex to check). The advantage of a separate P3303 is that it makes clear that the entity making use of it needs to do the formatting themselves, the Wikibase UI won't help. Merging with P1630 will confuse that.

* {{Keep}} It is important to distinguish primary 'official' formatter and the third party formatters.

* {{vd}} We don't have a rule that {{P|P1630}} can only be filled with official formatter urls. If we want to store information about some formatter urls being official we can do that better explicitely via qualifiers. In addition we can use the preferred rank to chose the formatter url that's used by default.

** I thought deprecation is needed to avoid that a former P1630 value is being used, that is: one can't add a new value with preferred rank to have these selected (as we usually do). --- [[User talk:Jura1|Jura]] 19:42, 2 December 2020 (UTC)"

*** FYI I added a preferred formatter URL a couple of days ago to {{P|8988}} and it DOES seem to have replaced the original one in the UI (after a few days to let it propagate). We might want to test some more, but it looks like maybe this issue is actually ok now.

* I feel like there is something important missing in this discussion. There are multiple use cases at play: 1. The built-in functionality of linkifying the property value. 2. Secondary links to various more- or less- related websites/tools using the same identifier. I completely agree the current official distinction between #1 and #2 (#1 is “first-party/official”, #2 is “third-party/unofficial”) is wrong (and that distinction is not even important or interesting) and does not match the current usage. What we need is one linkifying URL template (OK, we could use the preferred rank for that), plus a potentially unbounded set of URL templates with an agreed-upon way to indicate where that URL leads. I mean, {{P|5102}} {{Q|29509080}} is nice but in fact, I don’t really care. What I’d like to have is a drop-down menu next to each [[Property:P212|ISBN]] statement, showing me the links to various online book databases, libraries, e-shops, whatever (now, for the specific case of ISBNs, we outsourced this job to [[Special:Booksources]] which is the “official formatter” for ISBNs… funny, right?). Ditto for DOIs, OIDs, MeSH codes, … So, sure, we ''might'' merge P1630 and P3303 and use the rank to mark the primary linkifier. But I think it is not the greatest priority. For now, I’d say {{keep}} and '''rename''' both to indicate the distinction is not first-party/third-party, but auto-linkifier/additional links (cf. ArthurPSmith above). Then, let’s use {{P|137}} (or anything else) for ''each'' of these additional URLs, and then let’s build a gadget (or Wikibase core functionality) to use the data in the property. That would be useful. --[[User:Mormegil|Mormegil]] ([[User talk:Mormegil|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:24, 18 December 2020 (UTC)"

** {{ping|Mormegil}} I like this idea of a gadget to make these ""live"" - I think we'd need an additional qualifier though to label the links in a drop-down list, no?

*** {{ping|ArthurPSmith}} Yes, that’s exactly what I meant with the note about the {{P|137}} qualifier. Not because I’d consider P137 to be a great choice but it’s apparently already used for this, see e.g. {{P|230}}, {{P|1297}}, {{P|2037}}, [https://w.wiki/t92 etc.] ([https://w.wiki/t94 With some others] used as well, e.g. {{P|366}} and {{P|518}} have overlapping semantics with this, I guess.) --[[User:Mormegil|Mormegil]] ([[User talk:Mormegil|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:27, 4 January 2021 (UTC)"

***It seems to me EE works “inversely” in a sense, doesn’t it? I.e. on any page on Internet, it displayes whether it matches any formatter of any Wikidata property. On the other hand, my gadget displays next to every external-id property on a Wikidata item page links to all corresponding formatter URLs.

****{{ping|Mormegil}} It also works from WD items, and it does show multiple outlinks (e.g. to Twitter/Keybase/Scholia/Unavatar) if it rates them high enough (usually when they have a {{P|137}} or a matching language).
