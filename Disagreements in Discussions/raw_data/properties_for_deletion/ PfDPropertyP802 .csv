Same as for {{P|185}}: generally too many, and redundant with the reverse property. The most prominent students could be referenced with {{P|3342}} (and a [[Property:P2868|role]] qualified as {{Q|48282}}) instead. —[[User:Nomen ad hoc|Nomen ad hoc]] ([[User talk:Nomen ad hoc|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 19:38, 28 July 2019 (UTC)"

*{{vd}} Idem. {{P|802}} was originally supposed to keep only the main students but has been used in practice as an inverse property for {{P|1066}} (notably after the inception of an inverse contraint). I agree that using the property properly wasn't that obvious (sources rarely differentiate the main and secondary students of a person). Anyway, it is currently cumbersome to maintain and do not bring anything new.

*: {{Ping|VIGNERON}} Is there any rule or recommendation against one-to-many or did I misunderstand why you mentioned that? I suppose {{P|P1066}} is also one-to-many (so actually I'd say the concepts are many-to-many). Removing {{P|P802}} would supposedly remove also [[Property:P1066#P1696|inverse claim]], but it should first be investigated what that claim means in machine understanding of the property. I think many properties do enforce inverse property today, and even if it's cumbersome to maintain it might be re-added later if we can't make clear why it shouldn't.

*: {{Ping|Nomen ad hoc}} Did I misunderstand that the proposition was mainly a means to remove the less prominent/relevant student-relations. Are you suggesting to move each current claim as a first step, to prevent new students added and the ""relevance"" evaluated over time, or that the evaluation of relevance performed before the move? Isn't the problem in that case that {{P|P1066}} will still be overused?

*:{{Ping|Amadalvarez|Edoderoo}} When you say ""without loss"", are you disagreeing that the student property is overused or do you just want to make sure that the ''important students'' are not lost?

::*{{ping|Jagulin}} I understant this kind of properties actually mean ""remarkable students"", not ""all the students in his/her whole life"". So, if it has been overused, clean it is not a problem to me and even better for infoboxes, which must be a summary, not a list. However, may not be necessary to move to another property, but just clean it. My ""do not lose"" was refered to the effect of change the property, not to clean their not rellevant content.

*: {{Ping|Jura1}} I think it has been assumed that the inverse property is already matching, but you have a point in that this should be confirmed first. Do you agree that {{P|P802}} has been overused (for non-relevant students) and should those ""mistakes"" be transferred to {{P|P1066}} by bot or removed first? I interpret your vote here as ""moving to another claim will change nothing"", but I'm unsure if you also mean ""we should instead monitor data (e.g. relevance) and clarify the usage instructions"" or ""there is no problem with current usage"".

* {{keep}} I base this on reading the discussions here. Currently it hasn't been made clear what removal of the property would solve. I've asked for clarifications which may change my view.

If ""inverse constraints"" are not to be used (always cumbersome to maintain), that should probably be a bigger discussion rather than per property.
