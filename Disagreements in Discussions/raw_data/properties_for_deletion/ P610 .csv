:Then you have to add {{P|805}} to identify {{Q|513}} in {{Q|2}} and then add the coordinates of Q513  in ''two'' items! Would it not be better to use ""somevalue"" in P610 and {{P|625}} as qualifer when the place lack wp-notability? -- [[User:Lavallen|Lavallen]] ([[User talk:Lavallen|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 17:05, 7 October 2013 (UTC)"
