:* [[User:Ivan A. Krestinin|Ivan]], a nomination initiated with the one-word rationale ""Can."" is absurd and not worth discussing.  Beyond that, my rationale for keeping this property is based upon Denny's comment in [[Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2013/11#Freebase-Wikidata_mappings]]: 
{{quote|
   The suggestion is about linking to Freebase, just as we link to IMDB, VIAF, OSM, or MusicBrainz. Bots and tools then have the possibility to integrate data from several sources. This is not about copying data from Freebase or sourcing data to Freebase, but merely about having more identifiers. Personally I think the possibility to be an authority and identity hub for the whole Web is one of the great use cases Wikidata can be, and at the same time available to anyone and free to use.
    I am surprised that it is assumed that Google would have a particular benefit from having these links in Wikidata. Google has published these links, so obviously they already have them. This is about adding more keys and identifiers to Wikidata, making it a stronger hub for identity and entity reconciliation throughout the Web.|[[User:Denny|Denny]] ([[User talk:Denny|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 02:00, 13 November 2013 (UTC)"
"}}
:: If you or someone else want to have this property deleted then I recommend closing this nomination, and re-opening another a well-written rationale that takes into account Denny's comment above and the discussions in http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.org.wikimedia.wikidata/2285 and http://ultimategerardm.blogspot.com/2013/11/wikidata-freebase-interview-with-denny.html.  I would likely still oppose deleting this 'Freebase identifier' property. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 18:20, 25 May 2014 (UTC)"

::* Thinks for clarify. I have no interest for Sak4510 and his actions. Some time ago I reviewed IMDB, VIAF and some other. Its contain information that can be used for data verification and/or data import. I review Freebase too, but all found information was copied from Wikipedia and Wikidata by bot.

:* {{comment}} (continued) I want to point out that two things:
:: '''a)''' Is the Freebase - Wikidate relation is a ""'''''one way'''''"" issue? Are we able to create a peer to ask for new Freebase identifiers? Maybe some WD contributors are both skilled and willing to add WD related information to Freebase. Here some links:
:: ""''perfect''"" [http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/autolist.html?q=claim%5B227%5D%20AND%20claim%5B646%5D%20AND%20claim%5B1036%5D%20AND%20claim%5B1245%5D items with 227 GND 646 FrB 1036 DDC 1245 Omegawiki identifiers] – (208 items)

:: The second link is a point to start identifying Freebase records and adding them to WD. If necessary FrB records should be created first.

One reason might be that Freebase is mainly related / linked to en.Wikipedia and GND is not a copy of de.Wikipedia it is a national library database. This amount of data can not be handled by [[:en:crowd computing|crowd computing]] but with some maintenance / signaling conventions one could ""''mark''"" WD items which are ready to be used for semi-automatic Freebase record generation.

:: [[Template:FindP]] helps to identify the presence of some property values; the search for Freebase - using SLASHES - fails. Unfortunately there are no tools known to me to verify the backward links. I have seen a dozen of faulty links but there is no place to post them, it seems that nobody is willed to take care of them. The most evident method would be to use WD inline quality statements. No person and no bot can say it was not aware of their presence.
