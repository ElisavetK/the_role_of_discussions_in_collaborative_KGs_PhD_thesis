====Motivation====

{{Q|Q7847301}} is a database of {{Q|Q7889}}, mostly published on Xbox (but also Windows). It also has {{Q|Q1066707}} − I don’t think they warrant their own property though, so I integrate them here (we currently consider DLCs a subclass of video games). A little usage on English Wikipedia. The data model is per platform-realization, so there may be more than one entry for our Q7889 items.

* {{comment}} Aaarg, realised there is a numerical ID system which does resolves, eg {{Q|Q25340021}} → [https://www.trueachievements.com/game.aspx?gameid=6599 6599]. However, it does not work for DLCs. Meanwhile, there is a parallel ID system “Product ID”, which has a wider scope (also includes bundles), but does work for both games and DLCs (eg [https://www.trueachievements.com/products/27037 27037])… Not too sure how best to proceed...

*: {{re|Jean-Frédéric}} My suggestion would be to edit this property proposal to be for the numeric game ID and then create another for the numeric product ID. [[User:Jc86035|Jc86035]] ([[User talk:Jc86035|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:46, 8 April 2020 (UTC)"

*Withdrawing this − will likely follow Jc86035 advice and make new proposals. [[User:Jean-Frédéric|Jean-Fred]] ([[User talk:Jean-Frédéric|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 18:30, 28 March 2021 (UTC)"
