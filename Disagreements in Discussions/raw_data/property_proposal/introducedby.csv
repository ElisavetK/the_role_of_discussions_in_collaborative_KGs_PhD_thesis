====Motivation====

This seems to be sensible for situations where it's impractical to use {{P|751}} due to the number of new features being added by a particular version/edition. My particular use case is Unicode characters, where tens of thousands have sometimes been added by a particular version at once.

===={{int:Talk}}====
* {{comment}} So the idea is this is pretty much an inverse property to {{P|751}}, but only one of them should be used depending on which direction makes the most sense for Wikidata? I think this is ok, we have some other pseudo-inverses like this.

:*Yes, that's the general idea. To be clear, I think there are likely to be use cases where it makes sense to have both, and where it's practical it would probably be desirable for the sake of completeness (e.g. those MediaWiki features seem likely candidates, for example).
