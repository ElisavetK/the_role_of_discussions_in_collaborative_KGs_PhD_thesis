;Motivation

Exact mappings from an external vocabulary to Wikidata can be created via {{p|P2888}} or via a property of type external id for that particular vocabulary, which means that the thing identified by that property is excactly the same as the given item. This works very well for persons, and to a lesser degree for organizations, but often fails for general (abstract) concepts, or even for geographic entities. ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat#Wikidata_Mapping see discussion here]) Even when it would be valueable or at least legitimate to create a new and exactly-matching Wikidata item, this often does not match a main purpose of a mapping from an external vocabulary (to link to existing Wikipedia pages in different languages). That leaves the user with the choice of either creating an inaccuarate not-really-exact mapping using the available means (which may cause harm later on, particularly in derived transitive relations), or skipping the external concept completely. A ""close match"" property would solve this. [[User:Jneubert|Jneubert]] ([[User talk:Jneubert|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:12, 10 August 2017 (UTC)"

*{{Comment}} {{Reply to|Jneubert}} According to description, it looks like it's the same idea of {{Property|P1889}} Or are they different?Thank you [[User:ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2|David]] ([[User talk:ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 13:36, 16 November 2017 (UTC)"

** Hi {{ping|ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2}} Actually no - {{Property|P1889}} is about the relation betwee two item, whereas this draft for an proposal was aimed at the relation between an item and an external resource, identified by its URL. However, the whole draft is a (completely forgotten) leftover from an approach, which finally resulted in {{p|4390}} (using a qualifier for external ids with different allowed values), and probably should be deleted. Thanks for making me aware that its still lingering around.

***{{Reply to|Jneubert}} Do you mean that you are withdrawing the proposal? [[User:ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2|David]] ([[User talk:ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 14:39, 16 November 2017 (UTC)"

**** {{ping|ديفيد عادل وهبة خليل 2}} Yes (I actually did not submit it). I've added a note on top to make that more obvious. However, if you see a use case for such a property, I'm happy to discuss.
