* {{Comment}} It looks as though we should perhaps have three(?) identifier properties, the one in the given example ([https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/336843-the-maze-runner-the-death-cure movie/336843-the-maze-runner-the-death-cure]) having the formatter URL <code><nowiki>https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/$1</nowiki></code>. Also, the example's value should then be <code>336843</code>; the string <code>-the-maze-runner-the-death-cure</code> being superfluous. <span class=""vcard""><span class=""fn"">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class=""nickname"">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 21:02, 5 March 2018 (UTC)"

**Thanks, I've corrected the proposal based on your second suggestion. Regarding the first, I don't feel strongly either way so I'm curious about what others have to say on it. What would be a main reason for splitting this into three different properties?

*** they have different formatter URL's. You can only have one formatter URL per property (it is auto-linked from the identifier). [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 17:26, 12 March 2018 (UTC)"
