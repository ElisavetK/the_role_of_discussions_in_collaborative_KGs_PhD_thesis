;Motivation

I need a qualifier to show where a team promoted or relegated, to show where the team played the next season due to promotion or relegation of the previous season.

* {{comment}} In English at least, I don't think that ""at"" is the right thing for your use case. I would expect ""at"" to have a value of a location, an event or a time of day. ""to"" is what I'd expect, or possibly something more specific if ""to"" is too generic for others.

:[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]] An example:
{{claim|Q19906304|P2882|Q17442894|to|Q24067920}}

Is different from:

{{claim|Q19906304|P2500|Q19905070}}

*{{ec}} {{Replyto|Pigsonthewing}} It is only computable when both leagues have exactly one league above and exactly one league below, this is not always true. For example lower leagues very often have different geographical scope. For example a team relegated from {{Q|Q58916}} may play the next season in either {{Q|Q59041}} or {{Q|Q58915}} depending on geography not only of the relegated team but also that of other teams relegated to, promoted from and promoted to the level below {{Q|Q58916}}. A team in the Midlands may also move between leagues without promotion or relegation to balance the leagues (e.g. if only southern teams are relegated from the national level). The representation method on Wikidata must work for all levels, not just national to national.

:: It seems to me computable from the fact that the team is in session A in league X and in season B in league Y. If I additional know that the team was relegated it seems to me like all information is available.

:As I said above (and without getting a reply) the information is already possible to be calculated. Furthermore a short word like ""to"" as a high likelihood of being abused in for different purposes besides the one's defined here.
