:{{oppose}} Oppose without a general concept of size definition of object. Because there are plenty of other length parameters which can be used to describe an object and only a general concept can avoid the creation of specialized properties. Why not a property ""Dimension"" and a qualifier ""element"" which can be used for screen but other characteristics too ? [[User:Snipre|Snipre]] ([[User talk:Snipre|talk]]) 11:35, 1 July 2013 (UTC)"
