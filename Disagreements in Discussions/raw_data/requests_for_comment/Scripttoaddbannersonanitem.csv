[[File:Binomial authority - Wikidata 2013-04-14 11-22-59.png|thumb|The property with a banner]]
Recently, I see this page [//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Property:P394&oldid=24790939 Property:P394] with the ugly description ""''DO NOT USE THIS PROPERTY. IT IS PROPOSED TO BE DELETED.''""

<small>(I am not criticizing the fact that the text is here to prevent user from using this property. I only suggest just a prettier way to present it.)</small>

And it's why I create ""[[User:Jitrixis/itemNotice.js|itemNotice]]"". This script want to add a template on the top, on the bottom or on the side of the item.

'''How it's work actually :'''
*To add a template, We have to '''add an alias in English'''
*#<code>#HEAD:template!parameter=value!parameter2=value2!etc</code>
*#*To add on the '''top''' of the item
*#<code>#FOOT:template!parameter=value!parameter2=value2!etc</code>
*#*To add on the '''bottom''' of the item
*#<code>#ASIDE:template!parameter=value!parameter2=value2!etc</code>
*#*To add on the '''right''' of the item
*#<code>#NOTICE:template!parameter=value!parameter2=value2!etc</code>
*#*The template determine ''automaticaly'' the position of the template <code>(DEFAULT : ASIDE)</code>
*#**To add the default position on a template use:
*#**#<pre><span style=""display:none"">itemNotice:HEAD</span></pre>
*#**#<pre><span style=""display:none"">itemNotice:ASIDE</span></pre>
*#**#<pre><span style=""display:none"">itemNotice:FOOT</span></pre>
*What are the default parameter send to a template.
**itemNotice send by default <nowiki>{{the template and the paramaters|title=video|item=Property:P10|id=p10|isQuery=false|isProperty=true|location=HEAD}}</nowiki>

But I have many question about '''""How do we use this Script ?""''' :


== Do you think this script can be usefull ? ==
Do you think this script can be usefull? If you answer negativly, the script won't be official and won't be shown in the user interface.

# I can see where using the descriptions for such notices might come in useful. What happens when trying to use a property or item on another (for statements, for example)? It would show up there, but using this script, would that be possible? <b><span style=""border:2px solid;font-variant:small-caps"">[[User:Hazard-SJ|<span style=""background:#00008B;color:#FFF"">&nbsp;Hazard-SJ&nbsp;</span>]][[User talk:Hazard-SJ|<span style=""color:#00008B;background:red"">&nbsp;✈&nbsp;</span>]]</span></b> 02:01, 18 April 2013 (UTC)"
