"{{RFCSubpage}}  

Sometimes external databases/services erroneously create more then one entry for the same topic. And Wikidata users searching and adding the IDs routinely add all the IDs they find to the item, since they are all valid IDs. Then later, when the database/website gets around to fixing this redundancy, the entries/IDs are either turned into redirects or outright deleted.

'''The question is: what should Wikidata do with stored external IDs that have been turned into redirects or deleted? Keep them stored or simply delete them?'''

Over the years there have been various discussions and disputes between users over the handling of such cases. Unfortunately, official/help pages don't offer clear cut instructions for this case, which is why I'm starting this RFC to find a community concensus.  Some users (including me) think that these IDs still provide value and should be kept. The outdated IDs get marked as deprecated plus additional qualifiers like {{statement||P2241|Q45403344}} or {{statement||P2241|Q55396945}}. That way, they can still be found via queries, but are no longer flagged as single value constraint violations. Other users have insisted on removing such old IDs, as they no longer consider them valid IDs.

Among the problems that arose in the past were
* a) since most properties for external IDs have a {{Q|19474404}}, two or more IDs are automatically flagged as constraint violations and get listed on the constraints violations report page. And while marking outdated IDs as deprecated removes the constraint violation flags on the item page, the bots updating the constraint violations pages unfortunately fail to recognize the deprecated status and treat them like values with normal rank. Which results in deprecated values erroneously being listed as violations in the reports- prompting users trying to fix errors to simply delete these deprecated IDs in order to empty the error list.
* b) some bots have been programmed to check whether values of some external ID properties are redirects and then automacally replace these IDs with the IDs they are redirected to. Which means that instead of the current plus old values, there are suddenly several identical values stored for the same property. Which in turn automatically triggers other bots that remove redundant ID values. So in the end, older IDs that have been turned into redirects are removed without any human input.

Personally, I  think deleting these IDs instead of simply marking them as outdated doesn't really offer us any advantages. They were valid IDs at one point and we usually don't delete outdated data, we use ranks to indicate the current/best value. Just like we don't delete properties for external IDs when the external source is no longer around or changes to a different ID - we keep them for historical purposes and because there's still value in keeping them for our users. Our users might have datasets which still ccontain such IDs (including outdated ones) and can still use Wikidata to identify the subject of the deleted ID or even query the respective new IDs. Since Wikidata's importance and value as a central Linked Data Hub has grown immensely over the years, external IDs stored here aren't used just to create links on Wikimedia projects. Many third-party databases/services/websites or projects use such IDs and so they can be used (just as intended) for reconciliation between Wikidata and these external datasets. So if a dataset contains external IDs like {{P|244}} or {{P|345}} - be it current or outdated IDs - these datasets can be easily matched to the corresponding Wikidata item. But if IDs are stored here and considered valid IDs one day, but get deleted as outdated the next day, that doesn't speak well for Wikidata's reliability. --[[User:Kam Solusar|Kam Solusar]] ([[User talk:Kam Solusar|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:41, 6 June 2020 (UTC)"

== General discussion ==
* {{Keep}} them, please.<br>The main purpose of identifiers is *identification*, which works perfectly with redirecting URLs and even dead URLs. We do much better if we do not remove such identifiers, but use ranks instead to control visibility of multiple identifiers for the same property. Keeping them would be beneficial for external users, query federation, and in fact for us as well since it is a preventive measure against the redirecting identifier being re-added again after removal. (On a side note, I would prefer to use ""preferred rank"" for the current identifier and ""normal rank"" for the redirecting/dead identifier, in contrast to the recommendation above and current practice; the redirecting/dead identifer used to be correct, thus it does not qualify for deprecation in my opinion).<br>We even have the {{Q|Q52060874}} as a variant of the {{Q|Q19474404}} for such cases, but unfortunately it never really took off. Main problem is that the [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations|constraint violation]] reports are updated by a bot framework that has at best scarce support for rankings, and thus makes poor reports for every constraint type that involves rankings. For that reason, perfectly fine data situations are often impossible to remove from the covi report, and we have made some poor strategic decisions involving rankings and management of problematic content in the past. ‚Äî[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 22:14, 7 June 2020 (UTC)"

{{ping project|Authority control}}
* Firstly thanks to {{ping|Kam Solusar}} this very needed RfC on a very complex topic like this. Just a few days ago I have opened two discussions on specific properties, [[Property talk:P214#Removal of redirected and deleted IDs|'''this''']] about {{P|214}} and [[Property talk:P227#Removal of redirected IDs|'''that''']] about {{P|227}}, but probably a more general discussion is still better to find a balanced solution.
*:So, first of all I would make a distinction between:
*:# ''aggregators'': identifiers which contain no native information, but only aggregate other identifiers (notable example: {{P|214}})
*:# ''sources'': identifiers which contain native information (the great majority, e.g. {{P|227}}, {{P|244}}, {{P|345}} etc.)
*:I think these two categories of IDs deserve different treatments. As said by the Kam, we keep properties of external IDs which have become obsolete ""for historical purposes and because there's still value in keeping them for our users"". So, let's reason about why external users can use IDs: if an external user uses an ''aggregator'', he uses it because it aggregates different sources; if an external user uses a ''source'', he uses it for the information it contains in itself. The same is also true for Wikidata: we use ''aggregators'' because they aggregate different sources, we use ''sources'' because of their intrinsic value. Let's go further: if Wikidata contains not only an ''aggregator'', but also all the sources aggregated by it (which is the case of {{P|214}} and VIAF members), the external source can use Wikidata itself as aggregator, with no more need of the previous aggregator; so it becomes evident that keeping redirected and deleted entries of the ''aggregator'' is useless. Other aspect, valid at least for {{P|214}}: most of the duplicate IDs which eventually get merged are kind of minimal (see e.g. the 11 {{P|214}} in {{Q|102371}}; items having more than 10 VIAFs are not an exception as might seem, unfortunately), usually containing only one source, and they have basically no external use outside Wikidata, so keeping all them (after redirection) would make the item inconveniently heavier and less readable, with no real benefit for third parties. In conclusion, I strongly support {{vote delete}} '''''aggregators'' redirected/obsolete IDs''' when the ''sources'' aggregated by them are external IDs stored on Wikidata.
*:Now, let's come to the great majority of external IDs, those I called ''sources''. Here the problem is more complex, so pros for each solution should be evaluated. However, I should make a consideration first (point 0): I would consider inconsistent for Wikidata just having some redirects and not others; in other terms, if we choose to keep redirected/deleted IDs (obviously marking them as deprecated and qualifying them with {{P|2241}}), it would also be more consistent also to program, whenever possible, some systematic addition of redirected IDs to our items - if we choose completeness, why should we have only IDs which become obsolete ''after'' having been added to Wikidata? Also IDs which have become obsolete ''before'' being added to Wikidata would deserve addition, and there would not be any clear reason for reverting users adding obsolete IDs to items. If we consider how big is the number of redirects resolved in the history of big databases such as {{P|227}}, {{P|244}} and {{P|345}}, the quantity of obsolete information to be stored becomes relevant (see the above comment by {{ping|ArthurPSmith}}: ""unless there are thousands of them on one item, in which case I can see wanting to delete them""). Now I try to list some pros and cons, with objections:
*:#Pros for keeping obsolete IDs (I quote the good overview by {{ping|Kam Solusar}}):
*:## ""Our users might have datasets which still contain such IDs (including outdated ones) and can still use Wikidata to identify the subject of the deleted ID or even query the respective new IDs""
*:### objections: true, third-party sources can confront their IDs with Wikidata IDs, see that some IDs are deprecated on Wikidata and in that way delete them; however, an alternative way of operating is possible, if Wikidata chooses to delete obsolete IDs: third-party sources confront their IDs with Wikidata IDs, see that some IDs are ''absent'' on Wikidata, so they go checking by themselves if the IDs are still valid and they easily see that they have become obsolete - same result, only little more trouble, or maybe less trouble (quoting {{ping|Sotho Tal Ker}} regarding {{P|227}}: ""If a clean up of their data is needed, I would advise those third parties to use the primary database directly, not any secondary one which usually lags behind a bit"")
*:## ""Many third-party databases/services/websites or projects use such IDs and so they can be used (just as intended) for reconciliation between Wikidata and these external datasets""
*:### objections: this is the best point in my opinion; nevertheless, if Wikidata deleted obsolete IDs reconciliation becomes (only in the relatively few cases where these IDs where used by third-party sources) only more difficult, but not totally impossible
*:## ""But if IDs are stored here and considered valid IDs one day, but get deleted as outdated the next day, that doesn't speak well for Wikidata's reliability""
*:### objections: storing obsolete IDs can make the update of these IDs easier for third-party sources using Wikidata, but in my opinion reliability means mainly storing correctly ''actual'' IDs
*:## ""it is a preventive measure against the redirecting identifier being re-added again after removal"" ({{ping|MisterSynergy}})
*:### objections: good point, but such additions can easily be found through constraint-violations and/or by bots
*:#Pros for removing obsolete IDs (I quote some good ideas by {{ping|Sotho Tal Ker}} about {{P|227}}):
*:## ""There is no use in keeping distinct values if they actually point to the same source"" (cfr. when a Wikipedia page is moved, the information of its previous name isn't kept) + ""Keeping redirects will waste computing power as these redirects have then to be resolved externally""
*:### objections: basically true, they are redundant, but they can still be useful for third-party sources (see above 1.1 and 1.2)
*:## ""A cleaner database"": obsolete IDs occupy space (not so few, considering point 0 above) and make pages longer
*:### objections: the space occupied is maybe not so much (here some estimate on some properties would be useful to have a more precise idea of the dimensions involved)
*: Given all the previous points, weighing pros and cons, I tend to support {{vote delete|deletion}} '''also for ''sources'' redirected/obsolete IDs'''. --[[User:Ep√¨dosis|'''Ep√¨''']][[User talk:Ep√¨dosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 21:36, 8 June 2020 (UTC)"

=== First operative proposal ===
So, I‚Äôve continued reflecting upon this complex theme, in order to elaborate a ''first'' (obviously perfectible) operative proposal, which I divide into numbered points in order to make it easier to criticize specific parts of it. I want to thank especially {{ping|MisterSynergy}} and {{ping|MrProperLawAndOrder}} for their critics and {{ping|Bargioni}} for his oral suggestions, which I think helped me in forming a more balanced overview of the problematic, substantially changing my idea of the importance of keeping these IDs, ''at least'' for certain time, in order to allow external databases still to use them.

The main objective of this proposal, given that there seems to be strong consensus about keeping obsolete external IDs in general, is now to raise attention regarding three points which still don‚Äôt always emerge in the opinions expressed above:
* distinction between databases with wide external use (e.g. {{P|213}}, {{P|227}}, {{P|345}}), which deserve special attention, and databases with practically no external use (e.g. {{P|3630}}, {{P|5739}}), whose obsolete IDs‚Äô intrinsic value is yet to be demonstrated
* possibility or not to insert IDs which are already obsolete at the moment of insertion
* standardization of the way of treating valid IDs (preferred or normal rank) and obsolete IDs (normal or deprecated rank)

So, here is my proposal. 
# when an external database has an obsolete (redirected or withdrawn) ID, you should act in one of the following two ways:
## case 1: the external database is {{st||31|96192295}}, with at least five references which demonstrate the effective wideness of its external use (e.g. {{P|214}}, {{P|227}}) ‚Äì since the reason for which we keep obsolete external IDs is to offer the possibility to external databases of fixing them, we should make sure there are some external databases interested to the IDs we keep
### if an ID is still valid, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Normal rank|normal rank]] and should possibly be placed in first place
### if an ID already present has been redirected, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Deprecated rank|deprecated rank]] + the qualifier {{st||2241|45403344}}
### if an ID already present has been withdrawn, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Deprecated rank|deprecated rank]] + the qualifier {{st||2241|21441764}}
### if an ID has been redirected or withdrawn before being added to the item, it should not be added to the item directly as deprecated
#### an exception is made for redirected or withdrawn IDs which have been removed in the past: they can be reinserted directly as deprecated, because they were once present in the item
## case 2: the external database isn‚Äôt {{st||31| 96192295}} or has fewer than five references which support this statement
### if an ID is still valid, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Normal rank|normal rank]]
### if an ID has been redirected or withdrawn, it should simply be deleted
# technical notes:
## the bots updating constraint violations lists should be instructed about ignoring deprecated values
## the bots updating items should mark as redirected or withdrawn the IDs in the way mentioned above; if an ID has been redirected, they should also add the valid ID using normal rank and possibly placing it in first place
## the following option should be added to [[Special:Preferences]] and possibly enabled by default: in the section external-IDs, all deprecated values should be collapsed, with a button on each property allowing to show them ‚Äì the reasons are the following: most users aren't interested in viewing obsolete IDs, which make long pages still longer and may confound the readers; additionally, collapsing these IDs reduces the risk that newbies, not understanding their usefulness, remove them in good faith or accidentally
# <s>final note: in 2025 the choice between continuing keeping the IDs deprecated in 2020 or before and deleting them will be subject of a new RfC</s>

* {{comment}} You just created {{Q|96192295}} but I don't know what criteria would be applied to determine this; most likely we would miss some widely reused id's. Wikidata users generally don't even have a good idea of how our own properties or items are used by third parties. Some reuse would be in private data collections that we would never even know about. I don't believe making this distinction is good or useful; keep things simple.

*:{{ping|ArthurPSmith}} I expected this objection. The criterium of application of {{Q|96192295}} is simple: it is applied to a property adding as references the websites which use its IDs. Of course some private database could be missed, but I think that if a database is widely used, finding 5 websites which use it is quite simple, and if these 5 websites aren't found, probably the use of the IDs is very much limited and keeping them in view of private databases' utility may not be economic. However, I've created a second proposal below, removing this distinction. Please have a look and give your opinion about the remaining points. --[[User:Ep√¨dosis|'''Ep√¨''']][[User talk:Ep√¨dosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 17:21, 10 June 2020 (UTC)"

*:no [[:en:WP:OR]] please: The item Wikidata property widely reused by third-party entities (Q96192295) is more WD OR. Just operate on regular items. Add statements to {{Q|423048}} and {{Q|Q54506313}} etc. and then define in SPARQL what should be selected. But there is no sign yet people want to distinguish between widely reused or not. I would just start with GND and look how it works, as a pilot project. Then the processes can be expanded to other ids.

# when an external database has an obsolete (redirected or withdrawn) ID, you should act in the following two ways:
## if an ID is still valid, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Normal rank|normal rank]] and should possibly be placed in first place
## if an ID already present has been redirected, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Deprecated rank|deprecated rank]] + the qualifier {{st||2241|45403344}}
## if an ID already present has been withdrawn, it should have [[Help:Ranking#Deprecated rank|deprecated rank]] + the qualifier {{st||2241|21441764}}
## if an ID has been redirected or withdrawn before being added to the item, it should not be added to the item directly as deprecated
### an exception is made for redirected or withdrawn IDs which have been removed in the past: they can be reinserted directly as deprecated, because they were once present in the item
# technical notes:
## the bots updating constraint violations lists should be instructed about ignoring deprecated values
## the bots updating items should mark as redirected or withdrawn the IDs in the way mentioned above; if an ID has been redirected, they should also add the valid ID using normal rank and possibly placing it in first place
## the following option should be added to [[Special:Preferences]] and possibly enabled by default: in the section external-IDs, all deprecated values should be collapsed, with a button on each property allowing to show them ‚Äì the reasons are the following: most users aren't interested in viewing obsolete IDs, which make long pages still longer and may confound the readers; additionally, collapsing these IDs reduces the risk that newbies, not understanding their usefulness, remove them in good faith or accidentally
# <s>final note: in 2025 the choice between continuing keeping the IDs deprecated in 2020 or before and deleting them will be subject of a new RfC</s>

* re 1.4 ""if an ID has been redirected or withdrawn before being added to the item, it should not be added to the item directly as deprecated"" - No. As [[user:MisterSynergy]] mentioned on your talk page, redirects are just other names.

[[Category:Requests for comment not added to summary page by requestor]]

I am working much on data quality in Wikidata. I think discussed question is very important for Wikidata future.
* ""the bots updating constraint violations lists should be instructed about ignoring deprecated values"" - let assume that some item was vandalized and some deprecated value was replaced to obscene vocabulary. Should constraint violations list ignore this?
* We may think that deprecated values do not require any validation. Lets take a look to this edit: [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q46297397&type=revision&diff=1192391520&oldid=874399374]. Valid and actual code was added with deprecated rank. Should we close all our eyes to this?
* We have tons of completely wrong values in Wikidata. Just open constrains report of any wide used property. Misprints, bugs in import procedures, vandalized values, errors in external databases... Its are not fixed during years... Not fixed because we have no enough resources to keep the whole existing data in valid state. This suggestion adds much more work. Now we need working on processing and validation of deprecated values also. Who will do this? Why we think that we have enough resources to work on this also?
* How to validate deprecated values? Redirects is not a big problem. But how to deal with deleted values? Some databases keep deleted values, but another - no. archive.org will help in few cases only. So deprecated values will not validated actually. External users will think that Wikidata is collection of invalidated garbage. Such values will interrupt [[Wikidata:Verifiability]].
* Redirects. Some databases have ability to list all redirects. So we can import all redirects. But another databases have no public API for this. So we will have only some of redirects. E. g. item will have incomplete information. Incomplete information = wrong information from some points of view.
* Wide used deprecated values require much more complex algorithms for work. For example lets think about our merge tool. How it should merge [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q46297397&oldid=1192391520 this] and [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q95800612&oldid=1267559668 this] items? Both have PubMed=5943422 value. One have this value with normal rank, another with deprecated. Should the tool add both values to result item? Or do nothing and show error about conflict? It is simple example because we can ask user about something. But currently I am working on automatic merge procedures because we have tens of thousands items that should be merged. It is very hard task already due different types of errors and inconsistencies in data. Now I should increase complexity more and more for deprecated values processing, resolving conflicts in its and etc. And this story will repeat again and again in each bot, tool and other instruments. Wikidata is non-commercial project. Wikidata success is depend on entrance level for contributors. New tool creation should be simple process. This defines Wikidata success.
* Redirects and deleted values are interested for few kinds of tasks only. And we have item history page already - few users who really need historical values may analyze item history. Do we really need make usual tasks more complex to make rare used tasks more simple?
