"{{RFCSubpage|closed=yes}}
{{dtop|The close of this RfC is as follows;
* The interwikis for all Special pages is a failed proposal with consensus being mainly against it.
* The proposal for none of the interwikis is a failed proposal with around 45% consensus in favour.
* For some interwiki links on Special pages does not have enough discussion but it can see it is a far too broad proposal as-is.
** Special:RecentChanges is a failed proposal with a vote-based conclusion with consensus at 52% however argument based; it is a passed proposal. All the comments in regards to Legoktm's argument are ignore mainly due to the fact it is a design of a skin used by a small population of Wikimedia users and alone is a some-what old skin. Design factors of old skins should not steer consensus of entire projects.
** Special:Watchlist is a failed proposal. Even counting is design aspects, 300+ links on Special:Watchlist is not necessarily useful and probably not something Wikidata should be handling at this time.

The aim of this RfC is to gain consensus on the question whether we want to host interwiki links for special pages. Note that currently special pages are excluded by [[WD:N|our notability policy]]. The [[Wikidata:Notability/Inclusion criteria|only exception]] listed is [[Q6293548|Special:Recent Changes]]. However, recent deletion and undeletion of [[Q6293548]] showed that there is certain opposition to deletion of such pages, and the question is best discussed as RfC.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 20:50, 20 December 2013 (UTC)"

*Is this about interlanguage or interproject interwikis? You mention Wikipedia and we're on Wikipedia so I assume the latter. If you're interested in interproject links, please comment on [[m:Requests for comment/Interproject links interface]]. In the meanwhile, it's not too hard to import [[w:it:Template:Interprogetto]] and related code (or one of the other languages' versions, though most of them apart fr.wiki's and meta's are derivations IIRC). --[[User:Nemo_bis|Nemo]] 12:30, 21 December 2013 (UTC)"

=== Babel? ===
I agree that having 200+ interwiki's on a special page might be a bit over the top. Having none at all is not a very nice option either. I really like how babel works here on Wikidata: I included French on my [[User:Multichill|userpage]] and I see French. Wouldn't that be a nice approach for the special pages too? On [[:nl:User:Multichill]] I included Dutch, English, French and German. Would be nice if special pages like [[:nl:Speciaal:RecentChanges ]] or [[:nl:Special:Watchlist|my watchlist]] have links to the same special pages in the other languages I selected. From a technical point of view this should be too hard to implement I think. [[User:Multichill|Multichill]] ([[User talk:Multichill|{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}]]) 12:07, 21 December 2013 (UTC)"

:Maybe, provided the default is all the links. Logged in users get to set their preferences.

=== Notability ? ===
I have no strong opinion about linking or not special pages, I don't even really care, but what I'm pretty sure is that talking about ''notability'' here is a bias to the discussions as it is more a technical issue than a real Wikibase policy issue, that's why there is so much ''neutral'' votes. We should scope the discussions bInterwikis is the basic use case for Wikidata. the database is a secondary use. etween cases where Wikidata is a pure technical framework to handle interwikis and how this interracts with technical issue for Mediawiki projects, for which the ''notability'' word is kind of harmful as it will put the community with passionate debates and strong opinions, and real database management which are the main topic of Wikibase.
