Should data items here at Wikidata that are sourced to Findagrave be removed? Wikipedia considers Findagrave to be unreliable because it is community sourced. The argument for/against Findagrave has been going on for at least 5 years at Wikipedia. The discussion has begun at  [[User talk:Nikkimaria]] but should be open for all to discuss here. 

== {{Capitalize | {{Int discussion}} }} ==
*'''{{keep}} the source and the data''' We should be using the best available information at the time. When ''better'' information comes along, we edit. When we have contradicting reliable information we move the ''more reliable'' to the top position in the data field. No information, when some information ''is'' available, does not serve anyone. <!--We have thousands of entries with conflicting places of birth and conflicting places of death, all from reliable sources. Some sources use the location of the hospital where the person was born or died, and others use the legal residence at the time that the person was born or they died. In my family I have someone born close to midnight, so two birth documents have two different days for the birth. Compound the confusion if a birth is on New Year's Eve close to midnight.--> Freebase, the progenitor of Wikidata, imported the majority of its data from Wikipedia, which is also user generated and contains errors, as we all know. --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:46, 18 June 2017 (UTC)"

::Then Wikidata need to define what is ''better'' information and define some quality scale. I hope we all agree that a source that is researched by professional researcher like [[d:Property:P3217]] from [https://sok.riksarkivet.se/Sbl/Start.aspx?lang=en Dictionary of Swedish National Biography] has an internal quality process and has much better quality compared with a community-sourced. Wikidata need to have a process to make it obvious for the reader this ''quality/trust'' difference....  
::FindAGrave is  community-sourced and has a design problem 
::# FindAGrave never add primary sources for its information ==> major problem you can nearly never check what they present
::## adding pictures of the grave is encourage but not adding sources like birth certificates, death certificates etc... 
::# on 99% of the FindAGrave profiles there are no external links proving what is stated ==> you can never check what is stated and its a big risc that what is written is a copy/paste from Wikipedia
::# a test comparing two ""community-sourced""  genealogy sites WikiTree [[d:Property:P2949]] and FindAGrave [[d:Property:P535]] found a mismatch of more than 200 000 profiles [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Database_Errors_Project_2017-03-26#Added_the_rest_of_FindAGrave_Errors link]
::## another problem I have seen with community driven sites like FindAGrave is that you don't have a mature change process. 
::### profiles are protected
::### profile managers are not active
::### missing something like WikiTree/WIkidata talk pages makes the change process less transparent  
::### in FindAGrave you also has '''no''' support for version management ==> you can never track changes or see an earlier version 
::### the location model in FindAgrave is that you select from a predefined list box prefilled with places that maybe is ok in the USA but not in a place like Serbia ==> you cant sometimes add the correct place

::: Regarding #3: I don't think we can draw any useful conclusions about Find A Grave from the first table on that page, if that's what you're referring to. Two of the things in the list are finding cases where WikiTree is probably linking to the wrong Find A Grave page (which of course has nothing to do with Find A Grave). Two are listing cases where the two sites have different information, but that doesn't tell us which one has the right information (assuming WikiTree has the correct link). The rest are finding cases where Find A Grave has more detailed data than WikiTree. - [[User:Nikki|Nikki]] ([[User talk:Nikki|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:33, 20 June 2017 (UTC)"

::::The conclusion is that as FindAGrave don't source its information you can't check it. More detailed doesnt help much if its not sourced....
::::If you look at a WikiTree profile the intention is as with Wikipedia/Wikidata that you add sources connected to the facts, which makes it a better member in this echo system. As said earlier FindAGrave is not interested in using sources so they have very very weak evidences for the facts they state. For famous people I see often that both WIkitree and FindAGrave just copy/paste from Wikipedia... 
::::As said earlier we need a '''quality scale''' of sources. The debate over at WikiTree is that a lot of people gets upset because the ''Error reporting system'' tells its a difference between WikiTree and FindAGrave as FindAGrave has no sources its some kind of a ''dead end''...... - [[User:Salgo60|Salgo60]] ([[User talk:Salgo60|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:16, 20 June 2017 (UTC)"

*'''Remove, not a valid source'''. Poor sourcing leads to poor data quality; data that we can't trust is absolutely worse than no data at all.

* Automatically, importing FindAGrave data seems to be a bad idea. However, automatically removing it is also a bad idea. The point of quoting sources isn't just reliability, it's being open of the provenance of a statement. Removing data based on sources we don't like encourages people to provide no information about where the information they add is coming from. <br /> A person who doesn't trust FindAGrave can choose to ignore a value when we tell him that's where the information is coming from. Sometimes FindAGrave has the image of the tombstone which is very useful for having a good idea of the birth and death date of a person.

**The initial Wikidata data set was from Freebase via Google and was compiled mostly from Wikipedia, which is community sourced. Some of the information came from IMDB and similar data sets.

* I don't think we should have restrictions on which sources are allowed. Wikidata provides data for many Wikimedia projects, not just the English Wikipedia. We can't apply restrictions on sources from one project without forcing those restrictions on other projects (possibly against their wishes). It is better for Wikidata to remain as neutral as possible and for individual projects to filter out sources they don't want when using the data. The most important thing (in my opinion) is that the data ''has'' references. If the data has references, people using the data can choose which ones they want to trust. Removing or disallowing Find A Grave references will not prevent people from using it as a source, we just won't know that they have. There is no limit on how many references a statement can have. If someone wants the data to be referenced to somewhere other than Find A Grave, they are welcome to add additional references using a source they think is more reliable. - [[User:Nikki|Nikki]] ([[User talk:Nikki|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:41, 19 June 2017 (UTC)"

***** {{Ping|Nikkimaria}} well the recent inconclusive [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Verifiability and living persons|Verifiability and living persons]] RFC also went into the reliable source question - also inconclusively.

And there's been much discussion on Project Chat through the years too. There is definitely no consensus to remove ""imported from xxwiki"" statements - or references to any other ""unreliable"" sources at this point, with the wikidata community. And you still provide no specific example of a problem - what I'm expecting is for you to provide preferably several cases along the lines of: ""wikidata item Qxxxx has this statement Pyyyy vvvv sourced to FindAGrave, but it is incorrect according to this more reliable source zzzz"".

******* thank you for the examples. However, I note that neither BFI nor the newspaper you point to as sources for {{q|2991961}} death date (April 26, 2007) provide references, and the FindAGrave date (April 22) is supported also by IMDB. None of these meets a standard of ""verifiability"" beyond linking to the referenced source and seeing what it says. So, in a case like this, we should add the alternate stated date and its sources and leave it there as a disputed piece of information - if you suppress the April 22 entry you are hiding the fact that a disagreement exists. In the case of {{q|24169858}} I note that FindAGrave has a more precise death date than either of your references (which state only the year) so I'm wondering why you trust them more on the birth date? In the FindAGrave case, both birth and death dates can be further verified by examining the dates engraved on the gravestone, in the image provided there. So the FindAGrave values are MORE verifiable than the values from your other sources. Maybe whoever arranged the gravestone got it wrong by 2 days for some reason; again both dates should be added to indicate there is some disagreement on the topic. I don't find in either case here that FindAGrave is providing anything but a useful reference.

*********The point of considering a source ""reliable"" is that it is trustworthy in itself; something like BFI meets that, something like IMDB does not.

**** The person who creates a grave stone usually cares a lot more about getting dates right than a journalist who writes a newspaper artice under a tight deadline. In my experience with journalists that interviewed me, it's happens frequently that they get details wrong. Especially details that don't matter to their main case.

* '''My conclusion based on Wikidata policy and the consensus above.''' For the purposes of Wikidata, the website Findagrave is considered a ""serious"" source of data, and we recognize that it may contain typos and other errors, as do all data sets. At Wikidata when two sources differ, for example for the date of birth, the correct date is raised in rank, and a widely reported incorrect date is deprecated in rank. If it is inconclusive as to which is correct, the two dates are given the same rank. All Wikidata statements should be sourced. Findagrave typos and other obvious errors should be reported to Findagrave using their edit feature. For people born/died in the United States there are several databases containing birth and death dates that are based on official government documents such as birth certificate, marriage certificates, death certificates, and self reported documentation such as draft registrations, and passport applications. Even these dates may differ from each other. There are dozens of examples of people self reporting their birth dates in the WWI and WWII draft registration and giving different years for each. The same for people filling in passport applications. Generally the rule of thumb is that the document closest to the event in time, is more likely to be correct. For example the birth date given on a birth certificate is more reliable than the birth date given 20 years later in a draft registration or a passport application. --[[User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )]] ([[User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 05:04, 30 October 2017 (UTC)"

*{{Keep}} Findagrave ''is community sourced'' is not a good reason for not trusting it. Wikidata is also ''community sourced''. I will usually trust a gravestone more than other references for dates of birth and death and if the image can only be found on Findagrave than it is a great resource. --[[User:Jarekt|Jarekt]] ([[User talk:Jarekt|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 16:23, 22 November 2017 (UTC)"
