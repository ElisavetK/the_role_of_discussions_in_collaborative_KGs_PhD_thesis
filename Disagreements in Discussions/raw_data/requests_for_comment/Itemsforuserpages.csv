# {{oppose}} for the same reasons why I previously opposed the inclusion of userpages. Wikidata is a knowledgebase, to centralize information, not act as a mere interwiki repository. I don't like how this was proposed only a month after the previous discussion on this.--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] ([[User talk:Jasper Deng|talk]]) 18:46, 21 April 2013 (UTC)"

#: To give the proposer some credit, the issue was brought to project chat (presumably because he did not see the previous RFC) and told to start a new one if he wanted to change the prior consensus. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 03:26, 24 April 2013 (UTC)"

# Oppose, per my own comments below and previous discussion on the matter. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 03:26, 24 April 2013 (UTC)"

* There has already been [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Inclusion_of_non-article_pages#User_pages|an RFC that covered this]] and I don't see that the initiator of this RFC has offered any new arguments. So what is the point? [[User:Silver hr|Silver hr]] ([[User talk:Silver hr|talk]]) 21:45, 22 April 2013 (UTC)"

*: It's not fair to be everything else be like on Wikidata except user page. Much better it could then more interwiki bots would not have the function. --'''[[User:Kolega2357|Kolega2357]] ([[User talk:Kolega2357|talk]])''' 22:04, 22 April 2013 (UTC)"

*::I don't see how this is a question of fairness. Wikidata exists to create a database of knowledge, not to document the users (editors) of the Wikimedia websites. --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 03:25, 24 April 2013 (UTC)"
