I propose sorting identifiers alphabetically when displayed, so that user can easily follow them. If there are those of priority, they would be first of course (such as Freebase, or I don't know which but I know there are some of priority). Others can be sorted alphabetically or some grouped (e.g. Instagram always follows Facebook if available because they are of same characteristics). --[[User:Obsuser|Obsuser]] ([[User talk:Obsuser|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 08:54, 26 December 2019 (UTC)"

* {{comment}} There is already a sorting mechanism for Wikidata properties, but I don't believe it includes any of the identifier properties? [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:01, 30 December 2019 (UTC)"

* {{support}} I perfectly agree about the proposal of sorting identifiers in some way, in order to make it easier to find them. At the moment the sorting of all properties is managed through [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]], {{ping|ArthurPSmith}}; the only identifier which is sorted at the moment is {{P|214}}, which is set to appear first, {{ping|Ghouston}}, as a result of [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|this RFC]] which has just closed (to be more precise: the RFC resulted in a consensus to have VIAF as first identifier on human items; however, Wikibase-SortedProperties doesn't have the possibility to restrict a sorting to a class of items at the moment, so I had to enforce the sorting on all items).
: I agree with the proposal of setting first the most important identifiers and then others in alphabetical order; it can be considered the possibility of establishing an alphabetical order between topic-groups of identifiers (e.g. all cinema identifiers sorted alphabetically between them, then all music identifiers sorted alphabetically between them, then etc.). The most important task is, firstly, establishing which are the ''most important identifiers'', which should go first. I think two criteria should be considered: how many times a property is used and how diverse are the items where it is used. Looking at [[Wikidata:Database reports/List of properties/Top100]] (update six months ago), the most widely used identifier is {{P|698}}; however, it is used only in scientific articles items, so in my opinion it shouldn't go first; similar cases of sectorial identifiers are, in that list, {{P|932}}, {{P|5875}}, {{P|846}}, {{P|2326}}, {{P|830}}, {{P|351}}, {{P|5055}}, {{P|352}}, {{P|3382}}, {{P|590}}, {{P|3151}}, {{P|815}}, {{P|637}}, in some sense also {{P|345}}); in conclusion, the most widely used and ""universal"" identifiers seem to be, in this order, {{P|356}}, {{P|1566}}, {{P|214}}, {{P|646}}, {{P|244}}, {{P|213}}, {{P|227}}. However, there is a problem: this list has been updated six months ago and it takes into account all uses of the identifiers (not only as main value, but also as qualifiers and references), so it is not completely fit to our scope.
: Given all these premises, I would suggest to proceed in the following way: finding an updated statistic of all identifiers which have more than 500k (or 100k, as preferred) uses as main value; choosing, from that list, only the identifiers which are used on a wide range of items, not only in a restricted sector; sorting the choosed identifiers to make them appear always first; then start reflecting on the sorting of other identifiers, evaluating the possibility of sorting them alphabetically according to topic-groups. --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 12:25, 31 December 2019 (UTC)"

* {{support}} While teaching Wikidata, I have to stress to the students that the sorting of the IDs section is quite ""random"" and I don't like that. It's not a big waste of time but it looks sloppy. I might not fully agree with the choice of alphabetical order, in my opinion something based on effective use here could be more interesting, but I am not an expert. I mean that sorting alphabetically is not bad, it's clearly better than no sorting at all. I leave the final decision to more expert users, but I would like to see a decision of some kind.--[[User:Alexmar983|Alexmar983]] ([[User talk:Alexmar983|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 11:21, 1 January 2020 (UTC)"

** If you look at the labels on something like {{P|698}}, it's basically ""PubMed"" in any Latin-scripted language.

*{{support}} a general sorting approach by thematic groups - the approach we use for normal properties. So all the library-authority-type identifiers together, all the identifiers for sportspeople together, all the identifiers for genes together, all the identifiers for places together, all the taxonomic identifiers together, and so on. This will probably be the easiest and most intuitive for readers. It doesn't really matter what order the groups go in, as they probably won't appear on the same items very often.

::: That doesn't seem amazingly difficult, though? We manage fine for normal properties, and it can easily be an incremental project to tinker with as time goes on.
::: The more I think about it, the more alphabetical (or property-number-order) seems like a bad idea. Users will have to hop around a bit to find identifiers that naturally fit together - they'll be in a reliable order, certainly, but not necessarily a ''helpful'' one. Plus people won't always know that there are other relevant properties, or what they're called - an alphabetical list will be just as unhelpful as a random-order list if you're scrolling through looking for things that might be useful. Topic grouping avoids that problem, and it's consistent with what we already have.

=== Summary of previous comments ===
I will try to summarize the previous comments and then (in the next <s>hours</s> <small>days</small>) to make a concrete proposal below. So, at the moment 17 users have commented in this page, '''all of them supporting some kind of sorting''', and specifically expressing the subsequent opinions (please report if I misunderstood anyone!):

{|class=""wikitable""
|most relevant/used identifiers first, followed by others ordered alphabetically or by topic||3||{{ping|Obsuser|Nw520|Trade}}
|-
|most relevant/used identifiers (especially authority control) first, followed by others ordered firstly by topic and secondly alphabetically||3||{{ping|Epìdosis|Jc86035|Andrew Gray}}
|-
|identifiers ordered firstly by topic and secondly alphabetically||2||{{ping|Adam Harangozó|Moebeus}}
|-
|identifiers ordered firstly by topic and secondly maybe alphabetically||1||{{ping|CamelCaseNick}}
|-
|identifiers not ordered alphabetically, each project should choose most useful identifiers to put them first||2||{{ping|EncycloPetey|Wostr}}
|-
|identifiers ordered not only alphabetically||1||{{ping|Hogü-456}}
|-
|identifiers ordered only alphabetically||1||{{ping|Ghouston}}
|-
|identifiers ordered by P number||1||{{ping|ArthurPSmith}}
|-
|identifiers ordered by usage||1||{{ping|Alexmar983}}
|}

Given the technical limitations of [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]], we can assume (correct me if I'm wrong) that at the moment ordering by usage and ordering alphabetically are actually impossible in an automatic way; reviewing periodically the order of all identifiers given the stats about their usage is clearly inconvenient, so it should be discarded; sorting properties alphabetically can't rely on each user's interface language, but requires choosing one language (English). 

Given the previous summary, we can also assume (again, correct me if I'm wrong) that ordering by P number is not much supported and that ordering only alphabetically is also not so popular, while ordering in some way by topic is widely appreciated. --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 12:11, 28 February 2020 (UTC)"

* {{re|Epìdosis}} Before you formulate the formal RfC, is it actually necessary to do the sorting automatically (regardless of whether or not that's possible)?

=== Filtering and sorting ===
Discussing this RFC with {{ping|Gentile64}}, we agree about sorting identifiers by ascending P <b>number</b>.

== Proposal 1 ==
<small>Lists of properties: [[Wikidata:List_of_properties]] and subpages</small>

So, here is my proposal.

At the moment there are 4799 properties with datatype ""external-id"".

For now the only ordering enacted for identifiers is: ''{{P|214}} first'' (according to [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|this RFC]]).

According to some favorable opinions to setting authority controls first, I propose to set the following order:
# {{P|214}} (as it is now)
# {{P|213}}
# All VIAF members, ordered according to their VIAF code (51 IDs in total), as showed by the following query
#:{{SPARQL|query=
SELECT ?id ?idLabel ?cod
WHERE {
  ?id wdt:P31 wd:Q55586529 ;
      p:P1552 [ ps:P1552 wd:Q26921380; pq:P3295 ?cod ] .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ""[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en"". }
}
ORDER BY ?cod
}}
# {{P|356}}
# {{P|212}}
# {{P|957}}
# {{P|236}}
# {{P|7363}}
# All the other 4799 - 58 = 4741 properties ''temporarily'' ordered according to their English label [waiting for further discussions about the order of topics and of IDs afferent to the same topic]

It's obviously possible to propose adjustments or entirely different orderings.

::besides adding some geenric obvious guideline about taking into account massive cross-use as IDs or as sources or as authority control on local projects, we could allow a voting phase as a final passage... it's not perfect but a threshold of ""at least X users supporting the insertion above the alphabetical order with less than X% opposing"" is not elegant but more or less should work.

In most instances where these values appear, they are either on the wrong data item, or appear with at most one or two other identifiers.  So either we're emphasizing incorrectly placed data, or applying a data sort that will have almost no utility. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:10, 2 March 2020 (UTC)"

*:Looking at {{P|236}} I cannot see particular reasons for concern about wrong data, while the problem seems more serious for {{P|212}} and {{P|957}}, which are actually often misused in work-items. So, in my opinion the importance of one identifier isn't spoilt by the fact it's often misused (e.g. I would like to have {{P|214}} first even if it had 1M misuses; and ISBN is clearly the most important identifier for book editions, obviously from the 20th century), moreover the modification of the order would be less noted if the number of identifiers present in the items is small and this modification could make the problem of misuses more evident, prompting a discussion about possible solutions; in conclusion, I complessively think that this ordering would be positive, but if other users too think that evidentiating {{P|212}} and {{P|957}} would be bad, we can strip them out ('''proposal 1bis'''). --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 21:24, 2 March 2020 (UTC)"

*:: On Mediawiki we have a long history of people seeing something done, assuming it's correct, and copying the same to multiple other pages or items.  If we promote the ISBN identifiers, which are more often wrong than right, then we promote error in our dataset.  Unless someone is willing to regularly run a bot that strips out ISBN identifiers from items that should not have them, then giving the identifier priority will cause far more issues than it will solve. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 07:24, 4 March 2020 (UTC)"

*:{{ping|Succu}} The comment is true, although the difference is small (2128k vs 2030k). In my first comment I acknowledged that there are identifiers which are more widespread than VIAF, but I also said that they were much more sectorial, which is true also for {{P|846}}. Moreover, there are an inconsistency in your vote: [[Special:Search/haswbstatement:P214 haswbstatement:P846|there seem to be only 13 items]] containing both GBIF and VIAF ... so where is the problem? --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 23:36, 2 March 2020 (UTC)"

:Crap, how did I not see this?
:# It sorts *English labels* alphabetically; this is now even more confusing for users with another UI language than English, as it sorts mostly alphabetically, but some identifiers are placed incorrectly. 
:# ""Most important identifiers first"" makes an assumption about what's important; from my perspective, it lists less-important and even least-important identifiers first now, and particularly the VIAF matching is so much flawed that I consider it broken beyond repair.
:# It does not scale. Each new property needs to be added manually; each English label modification needs to be reflected in [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] as well.
:Can we please make this opt-in for users? The sorting of regular properties can be left activated by default, but please do not force me to use this. —[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 20:37, 16 March 2020 (UTC)"

:*{{ping|MisterSynergy}} Hi!
:*# As can be seen in the [[#Summary of previous comments|summary]], most users (among which me) strongly preferred a sorting which would take into account each user's interface language; unfortunately, [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] (the only way to sort properties at the moment) doesn't allow such a solution, so English has seemed to me (and to the users who supported my proposal) the best compromise
:*# """"Most important identifiers first"" makes an assumption about what's important"": it's perfectly true, opinions about ""most important identifiers"" can differ; if you have an alternative proposal for sorting, this can be voted of course (I numbered my proposal as ""1"" because I supposed other proposals would be made); talking specifically about VIAF, its first position hasn't been decided here, but [[Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|here]] (the RfC regarded only humans, but again [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] at the moment doesn't allow such a solution which differentiates sorting on the basis of {{P|31}}, so it was applied to all items), and the only objection which has been made has been ""{{P|846}} has more ids at hand than {{P|214}}"", which is true but in fact doesn't matter, because there is no item which has both properties. I know VIAF has many problems of clustering (we are trying to list them [[Wikidata:WikiProject Authority control/VIAF errors|here]]), but I think that the majority of the clusters is substantially OK.
:*# Yes, I know each new property and each English label modification should be added manually; however, it wouldn't probably be impossible to have it done periodically by an admin-bot (I will [[Wikidata:Bot requests|make a request]] if we decide to keep proposal 1). Of course something automatic would be much better, but again [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] doesn't allow such a solution at the moment.
::Finally, I would certainly approve making this sorting an opt-in; however, again, [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] doesn't allow such a solution at the moment. If you want to set your own order for identifiers, you can try [[User:Bargioni/personal sort identifiers.js]] - you can set an order for the identifiers, all the identifiers you don't mention will appear sorted by P number. I finally ask {{ping|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)}} to check all my claims about ""doesn't allow such a solution"" :) --[[User:Epìdosis|'''Epì''']][[User talk:Epìdosis|<span style=""color:green"">'''dosis'''</span>]] 21:25, 16 March 2020 (UTC)"

:::I know that we currently cannot make it opt-in using [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] only, but it should not be that difficult to implement something additionally ([[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedIdentifiers]] perhaps? Needs to be read from Wikibase of course, and needs a toggle switch in the user preferences). I'd rather not load even more Javascript code, as the Wikidata UI is already much slower than I can click and type on my actually not so bad machine and this makes my editing inefficient. —[[User:MisterSynergy|MisterSynergy]] ([[User talk:MisterSynergy|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 21:34, 16 March 2020 (UTC)"

*I am a little confused - the proposal above was to put half a dozen key identifiers at the top, and then ''temporarily'' (emphasis original) alphabetically. But now they're all alphabetically (inc key identifiers) and everyone is talking as though alphabetical is permanent.

=== Personal Sort using a script ===
As I proposed in [[Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Sort_identifiers#Filtering_and_sorting]], the sort could be managed on a personal choice.<br>
This solution can be implemented using a script I wrote: [[User:Bargioni/personal_sort_identifiers.js]].
<br>Please, test it. You can add it to your common.js. The default is P ascending number, but you can modify it predefining an array of Ps named ""identifiers_preferred_sort"". Comments at the top of my script describe the array, and include as well the possibility to enhance the functionalities of the script to more sort criteria, even the proposal of {{ping|Epìdosis}} about VIAF members.<br>
This script doesn't stop the discussion about the default sort, of course. --[[User:Bargioni|Bargioni]] ([[User talk:Bargioni|<span class=""signature-talk"">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 09:27, 5 March 2020 (UTC)"
