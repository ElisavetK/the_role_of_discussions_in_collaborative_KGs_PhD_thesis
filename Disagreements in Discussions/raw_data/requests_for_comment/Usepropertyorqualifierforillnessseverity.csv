I added {{q|Q96278582}} severity (of illness or symptom), with qualifiers for mild, {{q|Q96278776}} moderate, etc. But should any of these have been properties? I can't follow the description of the difference.
I want to be able to say things like:
* spinal cord injury - has symptom - paralysis - moderate, paralysis - severe (or just - not - mild).
* codeine - used to treat condition - pain - severity - moderate 
I am not sure if I also need to add extra statements to the disease / drug / severity / moderate qualifier etc to link these up.
